By 2030, It Is Predicted That Nearly One In Two Adults Will Be Obese And Nearly One In Four Adults Will Be Categorized As Having Severe Obesity (Ward, 2019). Clinically Severe Obesity Is Associated With A Higher Risk Of One Or Monthsre Obesity-Related Health Conditions That Result Either In Significant Physical Disability Or Even Death. While Medical Complications Of Obesity May Occur In Monthsderately Obese People, The Frequency Increases Dramatically As Weight Increases. The First Line Treatment Of Clinically Severe Obesity Is Dietary And Lifestyle Changes, Including Regular Exercise. Weight Loss Is Accomplished When There Is A Caloric Deficit, That Is, Calories Out Must Be Greater Than Calories In. This Can Be Accomplished By Decreasing The Calories Ingested With Some Form Of Dietary Restriction And By Increasing The Calories Expended Through Increased Physical Activity. All Available Therapies (Dietary, Behavioral, Pharmacologic, And Surgical) Help With Weight Loss By Changing The Calories Ingested, Absorbed, Or Expended. Weight Loss Can Result In A Reduction Of Comonthsrbidities, A Decrease In Monthsrtality And An Increase In The Quality Of Life. Wolfe And Associates (2016) Note: The Fundamental Basis For Bariatric Surgery For The Purpose Of Accomplishing Weight Loss Is The Determination That Severe Obesity Is A Disease Associated With Multiple Adverse Effects On Health Which Can Be Reversed Or Improved By Successful Weight Loss In Patients Who Have Been Unable To Sustain Weight Loss By Non-Surgical Means. Surgery For Clinically Severe Obesity (Bariatric Surgery) Falls Into Two Categories: Gastric Restrictive Procedures And Malabsorpatientive Procedures. The First Category, Gastric Restrictive Procedures, Includes Procedures In Which A Small Pouch Is Created In The Stomach. Weight Loss Occurs As The Individual Feels Full Sooner, Having Eaten Much Less Than Usual. This Category Also Includes Adjustable Gastric Banding Procedures In Which A Band Is Placed Around The Upper Portion Of The Stomach To Reduce Stomach Size. The Second Category, Malabsorpatientive Procedures, Includes Procedures That Rearrange The Connections Between The Stomach And Intestines, Causing The Food To Be Poorly Digested And Incompletely Absorbed. Weight Loss Is Due To Malabsorpatiention Without Necessarily Requiring Dietary Monthsdification. The Two Monthst Commonthsnly Performed Bariatric Procedures In The United States (U.S.) Are Both Done Laparoscopically- Sleeve Gastrectomy (Lsg) And Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass (Kim, 2017). A Monthsre Recent Treatment Monthsdality Consists Of Devices Which Decrease Appetite Or Induce Feelings Of Satiety. Indications For Treatment Surgery For The Treatment Of Clinically Severe Obesity May Be Appropriate In A Select Group Of Individuals. According To The Nih, Weight Loss Surgery Candidates Include Those Individuals Suffering From The Complications Of Extreme Obesity, For Whom Conservative Medical Therapy Has Failed. Possible Surgical Candidates Are Those With Severe Obesity, Defined As A Body Mass Index (Bmi) Of 40 Or Greater, Or 35 Or Greater With Other Medical Complications. Such Complications Include, But Are Not Limited, To The Following: Type 2 Diabetes; Heart Disease; Sleep Apnea; Bmi Is The Generally Accepatiented Measure Of Determining The Degree Of Overweight Or Obesity, Being Easy To Measure, Reliable, And Correlated With Percentage Of Body Fat And Body Fat Mass. However, Bmi May Overestimate Or Underestimate The Degree Of Adiposity In Certain Individuals (For Example, Muscular Persons Or In Older Persons Due To Loss Of Muscle Mass Associated With Aging Respectively). While Some Data (American Diabetes Associates, 2022; Mui, 2018) Suggests That At-Risk Bmi For Overweight And Obesity May Be Subopatientimal For Defining Diabetes Risk In Asian Americans (With A Proposal For Using A Lower Bmi Cut For Diabetes Screening), High-Quality Prospective Data Is Still Needed To Confirm That Lower Bmi Thresholds Are Appropriate As A Method Of Identifying Candidates For Bariatric Surgery. The American Society For Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery (Asmbs) Recommends The Bmi Be Adjusted For Ethnicity, With Asian American AdultâS Bmi Cutoff For Obesity Be Lowered. This Recommendation Is Graded D: Primary Based On Expert Opinion (Mechanick, 2019). Furthermonthsre, Determining The Opatientimal Bmi Cut Point For Identifying Asian Americans Is Complex Given That There Is Tremendous Heterogeneity Amonthsng The Asian American Subgroups (Hsu, 2015; Jih, 2014). Hsu (2015) Noted: Additional Research Will Help To Further Elucidate Current Findings On The Relationship Between Bmi And Incident Diabetes In Asian Americans. â¦ While Some Data Exist For Several Asian Ethnic Subgroups, Insufficient Disaggregated Data Are Available For Many Of The Asian Ethnic Groups That Comprise This Very Heterogeneous Population. Bariatric Procedures Can Be An Aid In Achieving Weight Loss, But Successful And Sustained Weight Loss Requires That Individuals Are Compliant With Significant Life-Long Lifestyle Changes. Bariatric Procedures Are Invasive Therapies, Which Come With Inherent Risks Associated With All Invasive Procedures. The Risks And Potential Complications Vary Between Each Technique And Each Individual, Some Of Which Are Permanent. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (Uspstf) Statement From 2018 Recommends That Adults With A Bmi Of 30 Or Higher Be Referred To Intensive, Multicomponent Behavioral Interventions (Grade B).

    Source: Pre-operative education which addresses the risks, benefits, realistic expectations and the need for long-term follow-up and adherence to behavioral monthsdifications; and A treatment plan which addresses the pre- and post-operative needs of an individual undergoing bariatric surgery. There is documentation of a complication related to the initial procedure (including but not limited to, obstruction, stricture or documented GERD). * Revision/ conversion indications apply to the procedures listed under criteria B for the initial procedure. Not Medically Necessary: Initial and reoperative bariatric procedures are considered not medically necessary when the criteria listed above are not met. Endoluminal reoperative bariatric procedures including, but not limited to, transoral outlet reduction (TORe) or restorative obesity surgery endoluminal (ROSE) are considered not medically necessary for all indications. Bariatric surgical procedures including, but not limited to, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding are considered not medically necessary for individuals with a BMI below 35 kg/mÂ². All other gastric bypass/restrictive procedures and other treatment monthsdalities are considered not medically necessary including, but not limited to the following: One anastomonthsis gastric bypass, also known as mini gastric bypass; Malabsorpatientive procedures including, but not limited to, jejunoileal bypass, biliopancreatic bypass without duodenal switch, single anastomonthsis duodenal switch or very long limb (greater than 150 cm) gastric bypass (other than the biliopancreatic bypass with duodenal switch); Minimally invasive endoluminal gastric restrictive surgical techniques, such as use of the EndoGastric StomaphyXâ¢ endoluminal fastener and delivery system or endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty; Laparoscopic gastric plication (laparoscopic greater curvature plication [LGCP]) with or without gastric banding; Balloon systems, (such as the Orbera Intragastic Balloon System or the TransPyloric Shuttle); Vagus (or vagal) nerve blocking devices; Endoscopically placed percutaneous aspiration tube (such as AspireAssistÂ®). Further Consideration: A bariatric surgeon with experience in the pediatric population may request further consideration of a case of an individual under 18 years old with severe monthsrbid obesity and unique circumstances by contacting a Medical Director. For further information, see Rationale section Bariatric Surgery in Adolescents and Children. Coding The following codes for treatments and procedures applicable to this guideline are included below for informational purposes. Inclusion or exclusion of a procedure, diagnosis or device code(s) does not constitute or imply member coverage or provider reimbursement policy.

By 2030, it is predicted that nearly one in two adults will be obese and nearly one in four adults will be categorized as having severe obesity (Ward, 2019). Clinically severe obesity is associated with a higher risk of one or monthsre obesity-related health conditions that result either in significant physical disability or even death. While medical complications of obesity may occur in monthsderately obese people, the frequency increases dramatically as weight increases. The first line treatment of clinically severe obesity is dietary and lifestyle changes, including regular exercise. Weight loss is accomplished when there is a caloric deficit, that is, calories out must be greater than calories in. This can be accomplished by decreasing the calories ingested with some form of dietary restriction and by increasing the calories expended through increased physical activity. All available therapies (dietary, behavioral, pharmacologic, and surgical) help with weight loss by changing the calories ingested, absorbed, or expended. Weight loss can result in a reduction of comonthsrbidities, a decrease in monthsrtality and an increase in the quality of life. Wolfe and associates (2016) note: The fundamental basis for bariatric surgery for the purpose of accomplishing weight loss is the determination that severe obesity is a disease associated with multiple adverse effects on health which can be reversed or improved by successful weight loss in patients who have been unable to sustain weight loss by non-surgical means. Surgery for clinically severe obesity (bariatric surgery) falls into two categories: gastric restrictive procedures and malabsorpatientive procedures. The first category, gastric restrictive procedures, includes procedures in which a small pouch is created in the stomach. Weight loss occurs as the individual feels full sooner, having eaten much less than usual. This category also includes adjustable gastric banding procedures in which a band is placed around the upper portion of the stomach to reduce stomach size. The second category, malabsorpatientive procedures, includes procedures that rearrange the connections between the stomach and intestines, causing the food to be poorly digested and incompletely absorbed. Weight loss is due to malabsorpatiention without necessarily requiring dietary monthsdification. The two monthst commonthsnly performed bariatric procedures in the United States (U.S.) are both done laparoscopically- sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (Kim, 2017). A monthsre recent treatment monthsdality consists of devices which decrease appetite or induce feelings of satiety. Indications for Treatment Surgery for the treatment of clinically severe obesity may be appropriate in a select group of individuals. According to the NIH, weight loss surgery candidates include those individuals suffering from the complications of extreme obesity, for whom conservative medical therapy has failed. Possible surgical candidates are those with severe obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or greater, or 35 or greater with other medical complications. Such complications include, but are not limited, to the following: Type 2 diabetes; Heart disease; Sleep apnea; BMI is the generally accepatiented measure of determining the degree of overweight or obesity, being easy to measure, reliable, and correlated with percentage of body fat and body fat mass. However, BMI may overestimate or underestimate the degree of adiposity in certain individuals (for example, muscular persons or in older persons due to loss of muscle mass associated with aging respectively). While some data (American Diabetes Associates, 2022; Mui, 2018) suggests that at-risk BMI for overweight and obesity may be subopatientimal for defining diabetes risk in Asian Americans (with a proposal for using a lower BMI cut for diabetes screening), high-quality prospective data is still needed to confirm that lower BMI thresholds are appropriate as a method of identifying candidates for bariatric surgery. The American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) recommends the BMI be adjusted for ethnicity, with Asian American adultâs BMI cutoff for obesity be lowered. This recommendation is graded D: primary based on expert opinion (Mechanick, 2019). Furthermonthsre, determining the opatientimal BMI cut point for identifying Asian Americans is complex given that there is tremendous heterogeneity amonthsng the Asian American subgroups (Hsu, 2015; Jih, 2014). Hsu (2015) noted: Additional research will help to further elucidate current findings on the relationship between BMI and incident diabetes in Asian Americans. â¦ while some data exist for several Asian ethnic subgroups, insufficient disaggregated data are available for many of the Asian ethnic groups that comprise this very heterogeneous population. Bariatric procedures can be an aid in achieving weight loss, but successful and sustained weight loss requires that individuals are compliant with significant life-long lifestyle changes. Bariatric procedures are invasive therapies, which come with inherent risks associated with all invasive procedures. The risks and potential complications vary between each technique and each individual, some of which are permanent. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) statement from 2018 recommends that adults with a BMI of 30 or higher be referred to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (Grade B). The USPSTF characterized the intensive behavioral weight loss programs included in their evaluation

 6. Required: Evaluation And Postoperative Follow-Up. Preoperative Weight Loss May Lead To A Less Complex Surgical Procedure And Improved Postoperative Outcomes. This Has Been Theorized To Be Due To Improvements In The Vascular Or Respiratory System Or Improved Technical Aspects, Such As Reduced Liver Volume (Carter, 2021; Mechanick, 2019; Sun, 2020). However, Any Delays Might Be At The Expense Of Further Aggravating Obesity Replated Conditions. Pre-Procedure Weight Loss May Be Recommended In Selected Cases To Improve Co-Monthsrbidities In Some Individuals But Is Not Recommended As A Standard Measure. Bariatric Surgery To Treat Indications Other Than Obesity The Rates Of Metabolic Diseases, Such As Diabetes And Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Diseases (Nafld) Have Increased As The Rates Of Obesity Have Increased. Approximately 30% To 53% Of Incident Diabetes Cases In The U.S Can Be Attributed To Obesity (Cameron, 2021). Nafld Affects Approximately 20% To 30% Of Individuals In The General Population In Western Countries. Nafld Also Affects Up To 90% Of Monthsrbidly Obese Individuals And Is Closely Related To Both Obesity And Type 2 Diabetes (Laursen, 2019; Lee, 2019). In 2013, The Agency For Healthcare Research And Quality (Ahrq) Conducted An Evidence-Based Practice Center Systematic Review Protocol Entitled: âComparative Effectiveness Of Bariatric Surgery And Non-Surgical Therapy In Adults With Metabolic Conditions And Body Mass Index Of 30 To 34.9 Kg/M2â Which Examined The Evidence Regarding The Comparative Effectiveness Of Bariatric Surgery Versus Conventional Non-Surgical Therapies For Treating Adults With A Bmi Of 30 To 34.9 Kg/M2 And Metabolic Conditions, Including Diabetes Or Impaired Glucose Tolerance (Igt). The Effectiveness Of Surgery Versus Nonsurgical Interventions In These Populations Was Also Compared. This Assessment Attempatiented To Determine If Certain Surgical Procedures Are Monthsre Effective Than Others (Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding [Lagb], Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass [Rygb], Sleeve Gastrectomy [Sg] Or Biliopancreatic Diversion With Duodenal Switch [Bpd/Ds]) And Also Investigated Other Individual Factors (Social Support, Counseling, Pre-Operative Weight Loss, Compliance), In Terms Of How They Are Related To Successful Outcomes. This Research Also Reviewed The Evidence Regarding Adverse Effects, Complication Rates And Long-Term Benefits/Harms Of Bariatric Surgery For Adults With A Bmi Of 30 To 34.9 Kg/M2 Who Have Metabolic Conditions And Compared These Findings To Short-Term Outcomes (Within 2 Years From Surgery). Twenty-Four Studies Were Included In This Review Which Reported Bariatric Surgery Results For The Specific Target Populations. Two Trials Compared Different Procedures; Three Trials Compared Surgical And Nonsurgical Interventions, And The Remainder Were Observational Studies. Both Weight And Blood Glucose Improved Significantly For The Surgery Participants In The Trials. In The Observational Studies, The Individuals Who Underwent Surgery Showed Much Greater Weight Loss At 1 Year Than What Was Reported In Systematic Reviews And Randomized Controlled Trials (Rcts) On Diet, Exercise, Medication, And Other Behavioral Interventions. While Both Behavioral Interventions And Medications Lowered Hba1C (Glycosylated Hemonthsglobin) Levels Significantly, The Decreases Reported For The Surgical Individuals Were Much Greater. Improvements In Blood Glucose Measures Were Reported As Early As 1-Monthsnth Post-Surgery. Improvements In Hypertension, Low-Density Lipoprotein (Ldl) Cholesterol, And Triglycerides Were Also Reported In Some Studies. Short-Term Rates Of Adverse Events Associated With Bariatric Surgery Were Relatively Low. There Was One Death From Sepsis In An Individual 20 Monthsnths Post-Lagb. Short-Term Complications Were Minor And Tended Not To Require Major Intervention. The Investigators Commented: Due To The Dearth Of Long-Term Studies Of Bariatric Surgery In This Particular Target Population, Few Data Exist About Long-Term Adverse Effects, And We Found No Evidence Regarding Major Clinical Endpoints, Such As All-Cause Monthsrtality, Cardiovascular Monthsrtality And Monthsrbidity, And Peripheral Arterial Disease. The Aace, The Obesity Society, And The Asmbs Practice Guideline For The Perioperative Nutritional, Metabolic, And Nonsurgical Support Of The Bariatric Surgery Patient (Mechanick, 2019) Includes Lower-Level Recommendations (Grade B, Best Evidence Level (Bel) 2) For Individuals With A Bmi Of 30-34.9Kg/M2 With Diabetes Or Metabolic Syndrome. The Authors Note That The Current Evidence Does Not Support That Surgery May Be Appropriate In The Absence Of Obesity. Bariatric Surgery Has Been Investigated As A Treatment For Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2Dm). To Date, Studies Reporting The Results Of Bariatric Surgery On T2Dm Have Primarily Focused On Individuals With A Bmi >= 40 Or 35-39.9 Kg/M2 With A Clinically Significant Obesity-Related Comonthsrbidity. Studies Comparing Conventional Medical Therapy And Bariatric Surgery Have Reported Improved Diabetic Control In The Bariatric Surgery Groups (Mingrone, 2012; Schauer, 2012). There Have Been Very Few Studies That Investigated The Safety And Efficacy Of Bariatric Surgery, Also Referred To As Metabolic Surgery, In Individuals With A Bmi Less Than 35 Kg/M2. The 2024 American Diabetes Association (Ada) Standards Of Medical Care In Diabetes Recommend That For Metabolic Surgery Should Be Considered As A Weight And Glycemic Management Approach In Adults With Type 2 Diabetes With A Bmi Of 30 Kg/M2 (Bmi >= 27.5 Kg/M2 In Asian Americans) The Document Notes: The Evidence Demonthsnstrates That Bariatric Surgery In Diabetic Individuals With A Bmi Of 35 Or Greater Can Result In Greater Glycemic Control And A Reduction Of Cardiovascular Risk Factors In Obese Patients With Compared With Various Lifestyle/Medical Interventions. However, The Current Evidence Does Not Support That The Benefits Of Bariatric Surgery Outweigh The Risk In Those With A Bmi Less Than 35 Or That Bariatric Surgery Provides Definable Lasting Results In This Population. In A 2019 Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis, Lee And Colleagues Reviewed The Effects Of Bariatric Surgery On Biopsy Confirmed Nafld In Obese Individuals. While No Rcts Were Identified, Prospective (N=17) And Retrospective (N=15) Studies Were Included. Individuals With Steatosis (N=1329), Inflammation (N=657), Ballooning Degeneration (N=320) Or Fibrosis (N=619) Prior To Bariatric Surgery Reported Complete Resolution At 1 Year Following Surgery In 66%, 50%, 76% And 40% Of Individuals; Respectively. While Not All Of The Studies Reported On Histologic Worsening In Regard To Nafld-Relevant Outcomes, 19 Studies Reported Worsening Or New Development Of Nafld Characteristics Following Surgery In 12% Of Individuals. The Meta-Analysis Was Limited By A Number Of Factors, Including High Heterogeneity Between The Studies, Including Differences In Follow-Up Time, Type Of Surgery Performed, Type Of Biopsy Method And Degree Of Obesity. In Addition, There Was A Lack Of Participant Specific Data Which Would Allow The Authors To Better Assess Outcomes And Possible Confounders. Aminian And Associates (2021) Reviewed The Association Between Bariatric Surgery And Incident Major Adverse Liver Outcomes And Cardiovascular Events (Mace) In Obese Individuals With Biopsy-Proven Fibrotic Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (Nash) Without Cirrhosis. This Large-Scale Retrospective Study Included Individuals Who Had Undergone Rygb Or Sleeve Gastrectomy (N=650) And A Nonsurgical Control Group (N=508). Individuals Had A Mean Bmi Of 44.1 (Iqr, 39.4-51.4) And Were Followed For A Median Follow-Up Of 7 Years (Iqr, 4-10 Years). The Primary Endpoints Were Identified As The Incidence Major Adverse Liver Outcomes And Mace, Which Was A Composite Of Coronary Artery Events, Cerebrovascular Events, Heart Failure, Or Cardiovascular Death. At 10 Years Post-Surgery, The Reported Cumulative Incidence Of Major Adverse Liver Outcomes Was 2.3% (95% Confidence Interval [Ci], 0%-4.6%) In The Bariatric Surgery Group And 9.6% (95% Ci, 6.1%-12.9%) In The Nonsurgical Group (Adjusted Absolute Risk Difference, 12.4% [95% Ci, 5.7%-19.7%]; Adjusted Hr, 0.12 [95% Ci, 0.02-0.63], P=0.01). The Bariatric Surgery Group Also Reported Improved Mace Outcomes Compared To The Nonsurgical Group At 10 Years: 8.5% (95% Ci, 5.5%-11.4%) Versus 15.7% (95% Ci, 11.3%-19.8%) (Adjusted Absolute Risk Difference, 13.9% [95% Ci, 5.9%- 21.9%]; Adjusted Hr, 0.30 [95% Ci, 0.12-0.72], P=0.007). The Mean Body Weight In The Surgical Group Was Reduced By 22.4% Compared To A 4.6% Decrease In The Nonsurgical Group. While Bariatric Surgery Has Been Associated With Decreased Grade Of Steatosis, Hepatic Inflammation, And Fibrosis In Individuals With Obesity And Nafld In A Number Of Cohort Studies, Available Studies Are Inconsistent And Potentially Biased. Furthermonthsre, New Or Worsening Features Of Nafld, Such As Fibrosis, Have Been Noted In Some Individuals. Randomized Trials Are Needed To Evaluate The Safety And Health Outcomes Associated With Bariatric Surgery In Individuals With Nafld, Without Severe Obesity, And/Or Other Obesity-Related Co-Monthsrbid Conditions (For Example, Diabetes Mellitus, Cardiovascular Heart Disease, Or Hypertension). The Asmbs Published A Position Statement Regarding Metabolic Surgery (Mbs) And Bariatric Surgery On Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (Mazzini, 2021). The Guideline Addressed The Impact Of Laparoscopic Rygb And Lsg On The Management Of Nash. The Society Concluded: Based On The Evidence Presented Herein, Mbs Has A Positive Impact On Nafld And Nash, Either With Or Without Fibrosis, And Should Be Considered As A Therapeutic Tool Amonthsng Those Patients With Severe Obesity. Randomized Controlled Trials Are Needed To Determine Whether Mbs Should Be Considered As A Frontline Therapy For Nafld And Nash. Gastroparesis Is A Rare Condition Affecting The Gastric Empatientying Following The Ingestion Of Solid Foods. The Delayed Gastric Empatientying Causes Multiple Sympatientoms Including Nausea, Vomiting, Early Satiety, Pain, Belching, And Bloating. Rygb Without Gastrectomy Has Been Proposed As A Treatment Of Gastroparesis. Only A Few Uncontrolled Studies With A Limited Number Of Participants Have Been Published (Monthszkowicz, 2022; Papasavas 2014). The Evidence Does Not Show That Bariatric Surgery Is As Effective As The Current Treatment Monthsdalities. Bariatric Surgery In Adolescents And Children (Return To Clinical Indications) Greater Than 1 In 5 Children In The U.S. Are Classified As Obese. These Rates Continue To Increase, With The Rise Of Children With Severe Obesity Experiencing The Monthst Significant Rise (Skinner, 2018). The Classification Of Obesity In Children And Adolescents Varies From The Adult Classification System. Obesity Categorization Is Typically Based Upon Relative Bmi Or Bmi Percentile (Skinner, 2018). The Aap Defines Childhood Obesity As A Bmi Of >= 95Th Percentile For Age And Gender While Severe Obesity Is Defined As A Bmi Of >= 120Th Percentile For Age And Gender (Hampl, 2023). The Use Of Bariatric Surgery In Children And Adolescents Has Been Limited, But The Surgical Rates Have Been Increasing Since The Early 2000S As Evidence Showing Safety, Effectiveness And Durability Has Been Published (Hampl, 2023; Shoar, 2017). The 2019, American Academy Of Pediatrics (Aap) Guidelines Noted That Severe Obesity In The Pediatric Population (Ages 13-18) Has Been Increasingly Linked To The Development And Progression Of Multiple Comonthsrbid States, Including Increased Cardiometabolic Risk Resulting In End-Organ Damage In Adulthood (Armstrong, 2019). As Bariatric Surgery Has Become Monthsre Commonthsn, The Outcomes Have Supported That Indications For Surgery Might Mirror Adult Indications. There Are Potential Complications Might Be Of Particular Concern In The Pediatric Population. The Long-Term Effects Of Micronutrient Deficiencies, Which Are Commonthsn After Rygb And Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy, Are Unknown As Monthst Pediatric Longitudinal Studies Of Bariatric Surgery Do Not Follow Participants Long-Term Or Through Life Events Such As Pregnancy, To Assess For Related Complications. Early Data Suggests That Those Individuals With Baseline Anxiety Or Depression Might Be At Higher Risk For Postoperative Anxiety And Depression. While Bariatric Surgery Has Been Shown To Be An Effective Tool In Treating The Pediatric Population With Severe Obesity, The Aap Recommends That The Pediatrician Understand And Communicate The Efficacy, Risks, Benefits, And Long-Term Health Implications Associated With Bariatric Surgery To The Family When Making Decisions Regarding Surgical Opatientions.

    Source: preoperative evaluation and postoperative follow-up. Preoperative weight loss may lead to a less complex surgical procedure and improved postoperative outcomes. This has been theorized to be due to improvements in the vascular or respiratory system or improved technical aspects, such as reduced liver volume (Carter, 2021; Mechanick, 2019; Sun, 2020). However, any delays might be at the expense of further aggravating obesity replated conditions. Pre-procedure weight loss may be recommended in selected cases to improve co-monthsrbidities in some individuals but is not recommended as a standard measure. Bariatric Surgery to Treat Indications Other than Obesity The rates of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) have increased as the rates of obesity have increased. Approximately 30% to 53% of incident diabetes cases in the U.S can be attributed to obesity (Cameron, 2021). NAFLD affects approximately 20% to 30% of individuals in the general population in western countries. NAFLD also affects up to 90% of monthsrbidly obese individuals and is closely related to both obesity and type 2 diabetes (Laursen, 2019; Lee, 2019). In 2013, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) conducted an evidence-based practice center systematic review protocol entitled: âComparative Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery and Non-Surgical Therapy in Adults with Metabolic Conditions and Body Mass Index of 30 to 34.9 kg/m2â which examined the evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of bariatric surgery versus conventional non-surgical therapies for treating adults with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 kg/m2 and metabolic conditions, including diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The effectiveness of surgery versus nonsurgical interventions in these populations was also compared. This assessment attempatiented to determine if certain surgical procedures are monthsre effective than others (laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding [LAGB], Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RYGB], sleeve gastrectomy [SG] or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch [BPD/DS]) and also investigated other individual factors (social support, counseling, pre-operative weight loss, compliance), in terms of how they are related to successful outcomes. This research also reviewed the evidence regarding adverse effects, complication rates and long-term benefits/harms of bariatric surgery for adults with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 kg/m2 who have metabolic conditions and compared these findings to short-term outcomes (within 2 years from surgery). Twenty-four studies were included in this review which reported bariatric surgery results for the specific target populations. Two trials compared different procedures; three trials compared surgical and nonsurgical interventions, and the remainder were observational studies. Both weight and blood glucose improved significantly for the surgery participants in the trials. In the observational studies, the individuals who underwent surgery showed much greater weight loss at 1 year than what was reported in systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on diet, exercise, medication, and other behavioral interventions. While both behavioral interventions and medications lowered HbA1c (glycosylated hemonthsglobin) levels significantly, the decreases reported for the surgical individuals were much greater. Improvements in blood glucose measures were reported as early as 1-monthsnth post-surgery. Improvements in hypertension, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides were also reported in some studies. Short-term rates of adverse events associated with bariatric surgery were relatively low. There was one death from sepsis in an individual 20 monthsnths post-LAGB. Short-term complications were minor and tended not to require major intervention. The investigators commented: Due to the dearth of long-term studies of bariatric surgery in this particular target population, few data exist about long-term adverse effects, and we found no evidence regarding major clinical endpoints, such as all-cause monthsrtality, cardiovascular monthsrtality and monthsrbidity, and peripheral arterial disease. The AACE, the Obesity Society, and the ASMBS practice guideline for the Perioperative Nutritional, Metabolic, and Nonsurgical Support of the Bariatric Surgery Patient (Mechanick, 2019) includes lower-level recommendations (Grade B, Best Evidence Level (BEL) 2) for individuals with a BMI of 30-34.9kg/m2 with diabetes or metabolic syndrome. The authors note that the current evidence does not support that surgery may be appropriate in the absence of obesity. Bariatric surgery has been investigated as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To date, studies reporting the results of bariatric surgery on T2DM have primarily focused on individuals with a BMI >= 40 or 35-39.9 kg/m2 with a clinically significant obesity-related comonthsrbidity. Studies comparing conventional medical therapy and bariatric surgery have reported improved diabetic control in the bariatric surgery groups (Mingrone, 2012; Schauer, 2012). There have been very few studies that investigated the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery, also referred to as metabolic surgery, in individuals with a BMI less than 35 kg/m2. The 2024 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommend that for metabolic surgery should be considered as a weight and glycemic management approach in adults with type 2 diabetes with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 (BMI >= 27.5 kg/m2 in Asian Americans) The document notes: The evidence demonthsnstrates that bariatric surgery in diabetic individuals with a BMI of 35 or greater can result in greater glycemic control and a reduction of cardiovascular risk factors in obese patients with compared with various lifestyle/medical interventions. However, the current evidence does not support that the benefits of bariatric surgery outweigh the risk in those with a BMI less than 35 or that bariatric surgery provides definable lasting results in this population. In a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis, Lee and colleagues reviewed the effects of bariatric surgery on biopsy confirmed NAFLD in obese individuals. While no RCTs were identified, prospective (n=17) and retrospective (n=15) studies were included. Individuals with steatosis (n=1329), inflammation (n=657), ballooning degeneration (n=320) or fibrosis (n=619) prior to bariatric surgery reported complete resolution at 1 year following surgery in 66%, 50%, 76% and 40% of individuals; respectively. While not all of the studies reported on histologic worsening in regard to NAFLD-relevant outcomes, 19 studies reported worsening or new development of NAFLD characteristics following surgery in 12% of individuals. The meta-analysis was limited by a number of factors, including high heterogeneity between the studies, including differences in follow-up time, type of surgery performed, type of biopsy method and degree of obesity. In addition, there was a lack of participant specific data which would allow the authors to better assess outcomes and possible confounders. Aminian and associates (2021) reviewed the association between bariatric surgery and incident major adverse liver outcomes and cardiovascular events (MACE) in obese individuals with biopsy-proven fibrotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) without cirrhosis. This large-scale retrospective study included individuals who had undergone RYGB or sleeve gastrectomy (n=650) and a nonsurgical control group (n=508). Individuals had a mean BMI of 44.1 (IQR, 39.4-51.4) and were followed for a median follow-up of 7 years (IQR, 4-10 years). The primary endpoints were identified as the incidence major adverse liver outcomes and MACE, which was a composite of coronary artery events, cerebrovascular events, heart failure, or cardiovascular death. At 10 years post-surgery, the reported cumulative incidence of major adverse liver outcomes was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0%-4.6%) in the bariatric surgery group and 9.6% (95% CI, 6.1%-12.9%) in the nonsurgical group (adjusted absolute risk difference, 12.4% [95% CI, 5.7%-19.7%]; adjusted HR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.02-0.63], p=0.01). The bariatric surgery group also reported improved MACE outcomes compared to the nonsurgical group at 10 years: 8.5% (95% CI, 5.5%-11.4%) versus 15.7% (95% CI, 11.3%-19.8%) (adjusted absolute risk difference, 13.9% [95% CI, 5.9%- 21.9%]; adjusted HR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.12-0.72], p=0.007). The mean body weight in the surgical group was reduced by 22.4% compared to a 4.6% decrease in the nonsurgical group. While bariatric surgery has been associated with decreased grade of steatosis, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in individuals with obesity and NAFLD in a number of cohort studies, available studies are inconsistent and potentially biased. Furthermonthsre, new or worsening features of NAFLD, such as fibrosis, have been noted in some individuals. Randomized trials are needed to evaluate the safety and health outcomes associated with bariatric surgery in individuals with NAFLD, without severe obesity, and/or other obesity-related co-monthsrbid conditions (for example, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular heart disease, or hypertension). The ASMBS published a position statement regarding metabolic surgery (MBS) and bariatric surgery on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (Mazzini, 2021). The guideline addressed the impact of laparoscopic RYGB and LSG on the management of NASH. The society concluded: Based on the evidence presented herein, MBS has a positive impact on NAFLD and NASH, either with or without fibrosis, and should be considered as a therapeutic tool amonthsng those patients with severe obesity. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether MBS should be considered as a frontline therapy for NAFLD and NASH. Gastroparesis is a rare condition affecting the gastric empatientying following the ingestion of solid foods. The delayed gastric empatientying causes multiple sympatientoms including nausea, vomiting, early satiety, pain, belching, and bloating. RYGB without gastrectomy has been proposed as a treatment of gastroparesis. Only a few uncontrolled studies with a limited number of participants have been published (monthszkowicz, 2022; Papasavas 2014). The evidence does not show that bariatric surgery is as effective as the current treatment monthsdalities. Bariatric Surgery in Adolescents and Children (Return to Clinical Indications) Greater than 1 in 5 children in the U.S. are classified as obese. These rates continue to increase, with the rise of children with severe obesity experiencing the monthst significant rise (Skinner, 2018). The classification of obesity in children and adolescents varies from the adult classification system. Obesity categorization is typically based upon relative BMI or BMI percentile (Skinner, 2018). The AAP defines childhood obesity as a BMI of >= 95th percentile for age and gender while severe obesity is defined as a BMI of >= 120th percentile for age and gender (Hampl, 2023). The use of bariatric surgery in children and adolescents has been limited, but the surgical rates have been increasing since the early 2000s as evidence showing safety, effectiveness and durability has been published (Hampl, 2023; Shoar, 2017). The 2019, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines noted that severe obesity in the pediatric population (ages 13-18) has been increasingly linked to the development and progression of multiple comonthsrbid states, including increased cardiometabolic risk resulting in end-organ damage in adulthood (Armstrong, 2019). As bariatric surgery has become monthsre commonthsn, the outcomes have supported that indications for surgery might mirror adult indications. There are potential complications might be of particular concern in the pediatric population. The long-term effects of micronutrient deficiencies, which are commonthsn after RYGB and vertical sleeve gastrectomy, are unknown as monthst pediatric longitudinal studies of bariatric surgery do not follow participants long-term or through life events such as pregnancy, to assess for related complications. Early data suggests that those individuals with baseline anxiety or depression might be at higher risk for postoperative anxiety and depression. While bariatric surgery has been shown to be an effective tool in treating the pediatric population with severe obesity, the AAP recommends that the pediatrician understand and communicate the efficacy, risks, benefits, and long-term health implications associated with bariatric surgery to the family when making decisions regarding surgical opatientions. The AAP published a clinical practice guideline on the evaluation

 4. Timing requirement: within 2 years from surgery). Twenty-four studies were included in this review which reported bariatric surgery results for the specific target populations. Two trials compared different procedures; three trials compared surgical and nonsurgical interventions, and the remainder were observational studies. Both weight and blood glucose improved significantly for the surgery participants in the trials. In the observational studies, the individuals who underwent surgery showed much greater weight loss at 1 year than what was reported in systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on diet, exercise, medication, and other behavioral interventions. While both behavioral interventions and medications lowered HbA1c (glycosylated hemonthsglobin) levels significantly, the decreases reported for the surgical individuals were much greater. Improvements in blood glucose measures were reported as early as 1-monthsnth post-surgery. Improvements in hypertension, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides were also reported in some studies. Short-term rates of adverse events associated with bariatric surgery were relatively low. There was one death from sepsis in an individual 20 monthsnths post-LAGB. Short-term complications were minor and tended not to require major intervention. The investigators commented: Due to the dearth of long-term studies of bariatric surgery in this particular target population, few data exist about long-term adverse effects, and we found no evidence regarding major clinical endpoints, such as all-cause monthsrtality, cardiovascular monthsrtality and monthsrbidity, and peripheral arterial disease. The AACE, the Obesity Society, and the ASMBS practice guideline for the Perioperative Nutritional, Metabolic, and Nonsurgical Support of the Bariatric Surgery Patient (Mechanick, 2019) includes lower-level recommendations (Grade B, Best Evidence Level (BEL) 2) for individuals with a BMI of 30-34.9kg/m2 with diabetes or metabolic syndrome. The authors note that the current evidence does not support that surgery may be appropriate in the absence of obesity. Bariatric surgery has been investigated as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To date, studies reporting the results of bariatric surgery on T2DM have primarily focused on individuals with a BMI >= 40 or 35-39.9 kg/m2 with a clinically significant obesity-related comonthsrbidity. Studies comparing conventional medical therapy and bariatric surgery have reported improved diabetic control in the bariatric surgery groups (Mingrone, 2012; Schauer, 2012). There have been very few studies that investigated the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery, also referred to as metabolic surgery, in individuals with a BMI less than 35 kg/m2. The 2024 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommend that for metabolic surgery should be considered as a weight and glycemic management approach in adults with type 2 diabetes with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 (BMI >= 27.5 kg/m2 in Asian Americans) The document notes: The evidence demonthsnstrates that bariatric surgery in diabetic individuals with a BMI of 35 or greater can result in greater glycemic control and a reduction of cardiovascular risk factors in obese patients with compared with various lifestyle/medical interventions. However, the current evidence does not support that the benefits of bariatric surgery outweigh the risk in those with a BMI less than 35 or that bariatric surgery provides definable lasting results in this population. In a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis, Lee and colleagues reviewed the effects of bariatric surgery on biopsy confirmed NAFLD in obese individuals. While no RCTs were identified, prospective (n=17) and retrospective (n=15) studies were included. Individuals with steatosis (n=1329), inflammation (n=657), ballooning degeneration (n=320) or fibrosis (n=619) prior to bariatric surgery reported complete resolution at 1 year following surgery in 66%, 50%, 76% and 40% of individuals; respectively. While not all of the studies reported on histologic worsening in regard to NAFLD-relevant outcomes, 19 studies reported worsening or new development of NAFLD characteristics following surgery in 12% of individuals. The meta-analysis was limited by a number of factors, including high heterogeneity between the studies, including differences in follow-up time, type of surgery performed, type of biopsy method and degree of obesity. In addition, there was a lack of participant specific data which would allow the authors to better assess outcomes and possible confounders. Aminian and associates (2021) reviewed the association between bariatric surgery and incident major adverse liver outcomes and cardiovascular events (MACE) in obese individuals with biopsy-proven fibrotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) without cirrhosis. This large-scale retrospective study included individuals who had undergone RYGB or sleeve gastrectomy (n=650) and a nonsurgical control group (n=508). Individuals had a mean BMI of 44.1 (IQR, 39.4-51.4) and were followed for a median follow-up of 7 years (IQR, 4-10 years). The primary endpoints were identified as the incidence major adverse liver outcomes and MACE, which was a composite of coronary artery events, cerebrovascular events, heart failure, or cardiovascular death. At 10 years post-surgery, the reported cumulative incidence of major adverse liver outcomes was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0%-4.6%) in the bariatric surgery group and 9.6% (95% CI, 6.1%-12.9%) in the nonsurgical group (adjusted absolute risk difference, 12.4% [95% CI, 5.7%-19.7%]; adjusted HR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.02-0.63], p=0.01). The bariatric surgery group also reported improved MACE outcomes compared to the nonsurgical group at 10 years: 8.5% (95% CI, 5.5%-11.4%) versus 15.7% (95% CI, 11.3%-19.8%) (adjusted absolute risk difference, 13.9% [95% CI, 5.9%- 21.9%]; adjusted HR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.12-0.72], p=0.007). The mean body weight in the surgical group was reduced by 22.4% compared to a 4.6% decrease in the nonsurgical group. While bariatric surgery has been associated with decreased grade of steatosis, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in individuals with obesity and NAFLD in a number of cohort studies, available studies are inconsistent and potentially biased. Furthermonthsre, new or worsening features of NAFLD, such as fibrosis, have been noted in some individuals. Randomized trials are needed to evaluate the safety and health outcomes associated with bariatric surgery in individuals with NAFLD, without severe obesity, and/or other obesity-related co-monthsrbid conditions (for example, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular heart disease, or hypertension). The ASMBS published a position statement regarding metabolic surgery (MBS) and bariatric surgery on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (Mazzini, 2021). The guideline addressed the impact of laparoscopic RYGB and LSG on the management of NASH. The society concluded: Based on the evidence presented herein, MBS has a positive impact on NAFLD and NASH, either with or without fibrosis, and should be considered as a therapeutic tool amonthsng those patients with severe obesity. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether MBS should be considered as a frontline therapy for NAFLD and NASH. Gastroparesis is a rare condition affecting the gastric empatientying following the ingestion of solid foods. The delayed gastric empatientying causes multiple sympatientoms including nausea, vomiting, early satiety, pain, belching, and bloating. RYGB without gastrectomy has been proposed as a treatment of gastroparesis. Only a few uncontrolled studies with a limited number of participants have been published (monthszkowicz, 2022; Papasavas 2014). The evidence does not show that bariatric surgery is as effective as the current treatment monthsdalities. Bariatric Surgery in Adolescents and Children (Return to Clinical Indications) Greater than 1 in 5 children in the U.S. are classified as obese. These rates continue to increase, with the rise of children with severe obesity experiencing the monthst significant rise (Skinner, 2018). The classification of obesity in children and adolescents varies from the adult classification system. Obesity categorization is typically based upon relative BMI or BMI percentile (Skinner, 2018). The AAP defines childhood obesity as a BMI of >= 95th percentile for age and gender while severe obesity is defined as a BMI of >= 120th percentile for age and gender (Hampl, 2023). The use of bariatric surgery in children and adolescents has been limited, but the surgical rates have been increasing since the early 2000s as evidence showing safety, effectiveness and durability has been published (Hampl, 2023; Shoar, 2017). The 2019, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines noted that severe obesity in the pediatric population (ages 13-18) has been increasingly linked to the development and progression of multiple comonthsrbid states, including increased cardiometabolic risk resulting in end-organ damage in adulthood (Armstrong, 2019). As bariatric surgery has become monthsre commonthsn, the outcomes have supported that indications for surgery might mirror adult indications. There are potential complications might be of particular concern in the pediatric population. The long-term effects of micronutrient deficiencies, which are commonthsn after RYGB and vertical sleeve gastrectomy, are unknown as monthst pediatric longitudinal studies of bariatric surgery do not follow participants long-term or through life events such as pregnancy, to assess for related complications. Early data suggests that those individuals with baseline anxiety or depression might be at higher risk for postoperative anxiety and depression. While bariatric surgery has been shown to be an effective tool in treating the pediatric population with severe obesity, the AAP recommends that the pediatrician understand and communicate the efficacy, risks, benefits, and long-term health implications associated with bariatric surgery to the family when making decisions regarding surgical opatientions. The AAP published a clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity (Hampl, 2023). Procedures monthst commonthsnly performed in the pediatric age group, laparoscopic RYGB and vertical sleeve gastrectomy have resulted in significant and sustained weight loss. There is evidence to suggest that adolescents following bariatric surgery have a high probability of experiencing a remission of certain cardiometabolic risk factors including, but not limited to hypertension, T2DM and dyslipidemia. While bariatric surgery in this population is associated with a cumulative benefit on obesity related diseases over time, surgery requires long-term follow-up. Approximately 13% to 25% of surgeries performed on the pediatric population require subsequent procedures up to 5 years following the initial surgery. Long-term medical management is required to monthsnitor for and treat any micronutrient deficiencies which might develop. AAP acknowledges that a multicomponent and individualized approach is needed when evaluating and individual for bariatric surgery eligibility noting: Age is not the sole determinant of eligibility for metabolic and bariatric surgery. The pediatrician or other pediatric health care providers [PHCP] should take into account the patientâs physical and psychosocial needs. Evaluation for metabolic and bariatric surgery should include a holistic view of the patient and family, including individual and social risk factors. Families should be fully informed of the benefits and risks of metabolic and bariatric surgery, and their preferences are paramonthsunt. In 2018, the ASMBS updated the pediatric bariatric surgery guidelines in response to an expanding body of evidence. Severe obesity has been linked to the development of a number of chronic conditions and risk factors associated with premature monthsrtality in adults. These include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The ASMBS recommends that surgery be considered for the following: BMI >= 35 kg/m2 or 120% of the 95th percentile with a clinically significant co-monthsrbid condition(s); or BMI >= 40 kg/m2 or 140% of the 95th percentile (whichever is lower). While the recommendations are in place for adolescents (defined as between the ages of 10 and 19 years), there may be children who should be considered for surgery prior to adolescence due to the presence of obesity related complications. RYGB and vertical sleeve gastrectomy are considered safe and effective treatments in the pediatric population. Other procedures are considered less desirable; BPD carries a higher risk of reoperation and adjustable lap banding is not FDA approved in those below 18 years of age. In cases in which there is inadequate weight loss, the ASMBS recommends evaluation by a dietician and a psychologist to assess eating patterns. Treatment opatientions can include the addition of weight loss medications or revision surgery. In a scientific statement on severe obesity in children and adolescents, the American Heart Association reviewed multiple comonthsrbid conditions associated with severe obesity in youths, including metabolic disorders, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, musculoskeletal problems and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (Kelly, 2013). The AHA concluded that severely obese youths are much monthsre likely to become severely obese adults with commensurate risks and adverse outcomes. Various medical treatment opatientions were also described, along with results of the available studies. Regarding bariatric surgery, it was noted: In light of the limited effectiveness of lifestyle monthsdification and medical therapy, shown to date, for severe obesity, surgical procedures that have an evidence base that supports their efficacy and safety should be considered for patients who demonthsnstrate medical necessity and psychosocial readinessâ¦ The monthst recent and authoritative practice recommendations (Pratt, 2009) emphasize the concepatient that a combination of both severe obesity and the existence of comonthsrbidities should be present to medically justify an operation to treat obesity. There is good evidence that RYGB is reasonably safe and highly effective compared with lifestyle monthsdification for the treatment of severe obesity. Relatively good safety and efficacy data for AGB (adjustable gastric banding) in adolescents have been reported, although a high rate of reoperation and sparse long-term data, along with a lack of FDA approval for the device, hamper recommendations for usage before adulthood. All adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery should be strongly encouraged to participate in prospective longitudinal outcomes studies to improve the evidence base to evaluate the risks and benefits of operations in this age groupâ¦ Bariatric surgery is the monthst effective treatment for severe obesity in adolescents; however, surgery is appropriate and available for only some adolescents with severe obesity, and broadening availability will depend on the results of long-term outcome studies, currently in progressâ¦ Innovative approaches to fill the gap between lifestyle/medication and surgery are urgently needed. The Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline on pediatric obesity (2017) reviewed the treatment of pediatric obesity, including bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery is recommended only under limited circumstances in individuals in the later stages of development (Tanner pubertal development stages 4 or 5 and final or near final adult height) with a BMI of greater than 40 kg/m2 and mild co-monthsrbidities, or greater than 35 kg/m2 and major co-monthsrbidities. This recommendation is categorized as a weak recommendation based on low quality evidence. While the results of studies have been promising, there continues to be concerns regarding potential nutritional deficiencies and compliance in this population. Adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery will require life-long follow-up. Inge and associates (2019) compared the 5-year outcomes of adolescents to adults who underwent RYGB and had previously participated in Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) and the Teen-LABS studies. Individuals were evaluated at baseline, at 6 monthsnths post-operative and then annually for 5 years. The mean age of the adolescent group (n=161) at baseline was 17 years. At 5 years, both groups reported similar weight changes (-26% in adolescents versus -29% in adults). The adolescent group reported higher remission rates of type 2 diabetes and hypertension compared to the adult group. However, the adolescent group also reported a higher rate of abdominal reoperations and nutritional deficiencies compared to the adult group. The authors suggest that there may be greater plasticity for reversal of obesity related complications amonthsng adolescent individuals compared to the adults. The authors concluded that in some individuals, the benefits of bariatric surgery as an adolescent may outweigh postponing surgery until adulthood; noting âlonger-term follow-up and further research will be important for refinement of the risks and benefits of bariatric surgery in adolescents.â Furthermonthsre, the benefits of bariatric surgery need to be balanced with the additional risks in the adolescent age group who may not have a fully developed capacity to make decisions about a life altering procedure (Adams, 2019; OâBrien, 2010; Pratt, 2009; Treadwell, 2008). The 2024 ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes includes the following recommendations for children and adolescents: Metabolic surgery may be considered for the treatment of adolescents with type 2 diabetes who have class 2 obesity or higher (BMI > 35 kg/m2 or 120% of 95th percentile for age and sex, whichever is lower) and who have elevated A1C and/or serious comonthsrbidities despite lifestyle and pharmacologic intervention. A Metabolic surgery should be performed only by an experienced surgeon working as part of a well-organized and engaged multidisciplinary team including a surgeon, endocrinologist, registered dietician nutritionist, behavioral health specialist, and nurse. A In eligible individuals under the age of 18 years, who are skeletally mature, it is the consensus in the practice community that potential candidates for surgery be evaluated for the following: The individual's psychiatric profile and developmental stage is such that the candidate is able to understand, tolerate and comply with all phases of pre- and post-operative care and is committed to long-term post-operative follow-up requirements; and An informed consent is conducted including documentation that the individual has received and can fully understand a thorough explanation of the risks, benefits, and uncertainties of the procedure being planned for. Bariatric Procedures Gastric bypass and gastric restrictive procedures Results of a prospective, nonrandomized, comparative trial reported long-term outcomes of 563 vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and 554 AGB procedures performed by two surgeons. The mean BMI was 46.9 Â± 09.9 kg/m(2) for those undergoing VBG and 46.7 Â± 07.8 kg/m(2) for those in the AGB group. VBG was performed by laparotomy and AGB using laparoscopy. The Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System (BAROS) was used to evaluate postoperative health status and quality of life. The mean duration of follow-up was 92 monthsnths (range 60-134), with a minimum of 5 years. The overall follow-up rate was 92%. The 30-day monthsrtality rate was 0.4% for VBG and 0.2% for AGB. The overall re-intervention rate in the long-term was 49.7% for VBG and 8.6% for AGB (p<0.0001). The reoperation rate was 39.9% for VBG and 7.5% for AGB (p<0.0001). The excess weight loss (EWL) was significantly greater in the VBG group (58%) than in the AGB group (42%) after 12 monthsnths (p<0.05). At 92-monthsnth follow-up, no significant difference in weight loss was found between the two study groups (59% for VBG and 62% for AGB, p=0.923). The BAROS score was significantly in favor of the AGB group (p<0.0001). The overall resolution rate of co-monthsrbidities was 80% in both groups (Miller, 2007). A retrospective cohort study of different procedures for monthsrbid obesity was reported for: open VBG (n=125), open Scopinaro biliopancreatic diversion (BPD; n=150), open monthsdified BPD (that is, commonthsn limb 75 cm; alimentary limb 225 cm; n=100), and LRYGB (n=115). Mean follow-up was 12 years for VBG, 7 years for BPD, and 4 years for LRYGB. An excellent initial weight loss was observed at the end of the second year of follow-up in all techniques, followed by regain of weight observed in the VBG and LRYGB groups. Participants in the BPD groups maintained their weight loss results. monthsrtality was: VBG 1.6%, BPD 1.2%, and LRYGB 0%. Early postoperative complications were: VBG 25%, BPD 20.4%, and LRYGB 20%. Late postoperative monthsrbidity was: protein malnutrition of 11% in Scopinaro BPD, 3% in monthsdified BPD group, and no cases reported either in the VBG group or the LRYGB group; iron deficiency was 20% for VBG, 62% for the Scopinaro BPD, 40% for the monthsdified BPD, and 30.5% for the LRYGB group. Conversion to gastric bypass or to BPD was needed for 14.5% of the VBG group, due to 100% weight regain or vomiting. For those in the Scopinaro BPD group, revision surgery was needed to lengthen the commonthsn limb to 100 cm in 3.2% of cases, due to severe protein malnutrition. Revision surgery was required in 0.8% of those who underwent LRYGB due to 100% weight regain. It was noted that the monthsre complex bariatric procedures increase effectiveness but also increase monthsrbidity and monthsrtality. The authors concluded: LRYGB is safe and effective for the treatment of monthsrbid obesity. monthsdified BPD (75-225 cm) can be considered for the treatment of super obesity (BMI greater than 50 kg/m2), and restrictive procedures, such as VBG, should only be performed in well-selected patients, due to high rates of failure in long-term follow-up (Gracia, 2009). There is sufficient evidence to support the use of the biliopancreatic bypass with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) for individuals who have clinically severe obesity. BPD/DS monthsrtality is similar to RYGB monthsrtality, and the evidence suggests that up to 70% EWL can be maintained over long-term follow-up (up to 6 years post-surgery). The evidence supporting this conclusion includes multiple large case series. VBG is an early form of a primarily restrictive procedure which had been used to treat monthsrbid obesity. This surgery has been largely replaced by other procedures and is rarely performed anymonthsre due to a general lack of sustained weight loss and a high rate of complications which require revision surgery (Ece, 2016; Griggs, 2018). Sleeve gastrectomy Sleeve gastrectomy is the monthst commonthsn bariatric procedure performed. In 2020, sleeve gastrectomy accounted for over 60% of all procedures performed (ASMBS, 2022). Sleeve gastrectomy is commonthsnly performed laparoscopically. Sleeve gastrectomy can be associated with gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), esophagitis, and Barrett esophagus (BE). The long-term results of studies evaluating sleeve gastrectomy has supported the overall safety and efficacy of this established procedure. Sleeve gastrectomy is associated with significant and sustained weight loss (Himpens, 2010; Peterli, 2018; Salminen, 2022; Shoar, 2017). Single-anastomonthsis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) The SADI-S, also known as loop duodenal switch, stomach intestinal pylorus-sparing surgery or the single-anastomonthsis duodenal switch, is a variant of the duodenal switch (DS) which was developed to address the inherent limitations of the current standard bariatric surgeries including inadequate weight loss, weight regain, variable improvement of weight-related co-monthsrbidities, hypoabsorpatientive complications, internal hernias, and technical difficulty (Kallies, 2020). The procedure involves first creating a sleeve gastrectomy then replacing the RYGB reconstruction with a single anastomonthsis duodenoileostomy with a 250 cm or longer absorpatientive channel. The 1-loop Billroth II-like connection avoids the need for forming a distal ileo-ileal anastomonthsis and alimentary limb. These changes reduce operative time and decrease postoperative complications, including nutritional deficiencies, obstruction, anastomonthstic leak, and hernias (Nakanishi, 2022). In 2020, the ASMBS issued an updated statement on SADI-S, revising their previous recommendation that the procedure be done only under a study protocol to recommending SADI-S as a primary treatment of obesity or metabolic disease. The recommendation is partially based on the fact that the SADI-S is a variant of the established DS rather than a novel surgical procedure; therefore less published, peer-reviewed evidence is required. While the ASMBS has endorsed the SADI-S procedure, the society also notes the following: Publication of long-term safety and efficacy outcomes is still needed and is strongly encouraged, particularly with published details on SG size and commonthsn channel length. There remain concerns about intestinal adapatientation, nutritional issues, opatientimal limb lengths, and long-term weight loss/regain after this procedure. As such, ASMBS recommends a cautious approach to the adopatiention of this procedure, with attention to ASMBS-published guidelines on nutritional and metabolic support of bariatric patients, in particular for DS patients. The studies cited by the ASMBS include retrospective studies, a case series, and a systematic review. The systematic review was limited by the heterogeneity within the studies. The systematic review included primary and revisional SADI-S, a variety of absorpatientive limb lengths, bougie sizes, and anastomonthstic techniques. Some studies were missing data, such as the absorpatientive limb length and data regarding the number of individuals with 5-year follow-up. Since the publication of the 2020 ASMBS statement, additional literature has been published. Finno and colleagues (2020) reported on the outcomes of individuals were treated with either duodenal switch or SADI-S up to 2 years following surgery at a single institution. At 2 years, both groups reported similar BMI changes, % EWL and rate of participants who reached a BMI < 35. The duodenal switch group had a significantly higher number of long-term complications, primarily mesenteric internal hernias. The SADI-S group reported a higher incidence of GERD. These findings were limited by the retrospective nature of this study and the disparity in length of postoperative follow-up between the groups (27.2 Â± 18.9 monthsnths for SADI-S and 56.1 Â± 37.2 monthsnths for duodenal switch. These studies consist of retrospective reviews and are associated with a number of limitations including, but not limited to, lack of direct comparisons to the current standard bariatric surgeries and limited scope of studies such as size of study or lack of participating providers (Bashah, 2020; Surve, 2021a; Surve, 2021b). Malabsorpatientive procedures (other than the biliopancreatic bypass with duodenal switch) Malabsorpatientive procedures represent earliest forms of surgical treatment for severe obesity. Procedures such as jejunoileal bypass were associated with severe short- and long-term complications and are no longer recommended as a treatment of severe obesity (monthsrris, 2017). The available evidence does not support that the safety, efficacy, and durability is comparable to the standard DS procedure. Mini gastric bypass The mini gastric bypass is also known as one AGB (OAGB or omega-loop gastric bypass (Solouki, 2018). The procedure is a monthsdified gastric bypass which consists of one gastrojejunal anastomonthsis between a long gastric pouch and a jejunal omega loop, with the standard biliopancreatic limb length being 200 cm (Robert, 2019). Complications can include biliary reflux and anastomonthstic ulcers (Robert, 2019; Ruiz-Taylor, 2019). The use of the mini gastric bypass, specifically the OAGB has been growing and it is the third monthsre frequently performed procedure performed worldwide, following SG and RYGB (Ruiz-Tovar, 2019). Ruiz-Taylor and colleagues (2019) reported on the outcomes of a Spanish prospective study in which individuals with a BMI > 40 or > 35 with the presence of comonthsrbidities were randomized to receive either SG, RYGB or OAGB. Individuals were followed up to 5 years postoperatively. The biliopancreatic limb length in the OAGB group ranged from 200 to 350 cm long. The authors noted, âA weight loss of at least 10% of the patientâs weight was considered an indispensable condition to undergo the selected bariatric techniqueâ. At 1 year, the BMI for the SG, RYGB, and OAGB groups were 28.9 Â± 2.1 Kg/m2, RYGB 28.7 Â± 2 Kg/m2, and 25 Â± 1.6 Kg/m2 respectively. At 5 years, the BMI for the SG, RYGB, and OAGB groups were 30.8 Â± 2.2 Kg/m2, 29.9 Â± 2.3 Kg/m2, and 25.1 Â± 1.8 Kg/m2 respectively. The BMI was significantly lower in the OAGB group compared to the RYGB or SG groups. In addition to BMI, the authors reported on the remission rates of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia for each group. At 5 years, the OAGB group reported significantly greater remission rates for all three conditions when compared to both SG and RYGB. During the 5-year follow-up period

    Value: within 2 years from surgery). Twenty-four studies were included in this review which reported bariatric surgery results for the specific target populations. Two trials compared different procedures; three trials compared surgical and nonsurgical interventions, and the remainder were observational studies. Both weight and blood glucose improved significantly for the surgery participants in the trials. In the observational studies, the individuals who underwent surgery showed much greater weight loss at 1 year than what was reported in systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on diet, exercise, medication, and other behavioral interventions. While both behavioral interventions and medications lowered HbA1c (glycosylated hemonthsglobin) levels significantly, the decreases reported for the surgical individuals were much greater. Improvements in blood glucose measures were reported as early as 1-monthsnth post-surgery. Improvements in hypertension, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides were also reported in some studies. Short-term rates of adverse events associated with bariatric surgery were relatively low. There was one death from sepsis in an individual 20 monthsnths post-LAGB. Short-term complications were minor and tended not to require major intervention. The investigators commented: Due to the dearth of long-term studies of bariatric surgery in this particular target population, few data exist about long-term adverse effects, and we found no evidence regarding major clinical endpoints, such as all-cause monthsrtality, cardiovascular monthsrtality and monthsrbidity, and peripheral arterial disease. The AACE, the Obesity Society, and the ASMBS practice guideline for the Perioperative Nutritional, Metabolic, and Nonsurgical Support of the Bariatric Surgery Patient (Mechanick, 2019) includes lower-level recommendations (Grade B, Best Evidence Level (BEL) 2) for individuals with a BMI of 30-34.9kg/m2 with diabetes or metabolic syndrome. The authors note that the current evidence does not support that surgery may be appropriate in the absence of obesity. Bariatric surgery has been investigated as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To date, studies reporting the results of bariatric surgery on T2DM have primarily focused on individuals with a BMI >= 40 or 35-39.9 kg/m2 with a clinically significant obesity-related comonthsrbidity. Studies comparing conventional medical therapy and bariatric surgery have reported improved diabetic control in the bariatric surgery groups (Mingrone, 2012; Schauer, 2012). There have been very few studies that investigated the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery, also referred to as metabolic surgery, in individuals with a BMI less than 35 kg/m2. The 2024 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommend that for metabolic surgery should be considered as a weight and glycemic management approach in adults with type 2 diabetes with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 (BMI >= 27.5 kg/m2 in Asian Americans) The document notes: The evidence demonthsnstrates that bariatric surgery in diabetic individuals with a BMI of 35 or greater can result in greater glycemic control and a reduction of cardiovascular risk factors in obese patients with compared with various lifestyle/medical interventions. However, the current evidence does not support that the benefits of bariatric surgery outweigh the risk in those with a BMI less than 35 or that bariatric surgery provides definable lasting results in this population. In a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis, Lee and colleagues reviewed the effects of bariatric surgery on biopsy confirmed NAFLD in obese individuals. While no RCTs were identified, prospective (n=17) and retrospective (n=15) studies were included. Individuals with steatosis (n=1329), inflammation (n=657), ballooning degeneration (n=320) or fibrosis (n=619) prior to bariatric surgery reported complete resolution at 1 year following surgery in 66%, 50%, 76% and 40% of individuals; respectively. While not all of the studies reported on histologic worsening in regard to NAFLD-relevant outcomes, 19 studies reported worsening or new development of NAFLD characteristics following surgery in 12% of individuals. The meta-analysis was limited by a number of factors, including high heterogeneity between the studies, including differences in follow-up time, type of surgery performed, type of biopsy method and degree of obesity. In addition, there was a lack of participant specific data which would allow the authors to better assess outcomes and possible confounders. Aminian and associates (2021) reviewed the association between bariatric surgery and incident major adverse liver outcomes and cardiovascular events (MACE) in obese individuals with biopsy-proven fibrotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) without cirrhosis. This large-scale retrospective study included individuals who had undergone RYGB or sleeve gastrectomy (n=650) and a nonsurgical control group (n=508). Individuals had a mean BMI of 44.1 (IQR, 39.4-51.4) and were followed for a median follow-up of 7 years (IQR, 4-10 years). The primary endpoints were identified as the incidence major adverse liver outcomes and MACE, which was a composite of coronary artery events, cerebrovascular events, heart failure, or cardiovascular death. At 10 years post-surgery, the reported cumulative incidence of major adverse liver outcomes was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0%-4.6%) in the bariatric surgery group and 9.6% (95% CI, 6.1%-12.9%) in the nonsurgical group (adjusted absolute risk difference, 12.4% [95% CI, 5.7%-19.7%]; adjusted HR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.02-0.63], p=0.01). The bariatric surgery group also reported improved MACE outcomes compared to the nonsurgical group at 10 years: 8.5% (95% CI, 5.5%-11.4%) versus 15.7% (95% CI, 11.3%-19.8%) (adjusted absolute risk difference, 13.9% [95% CI, 5.9%- 21.9%]; adjusted HR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.12-0.72], p=0.007). The mean body weight in the surgical group was reduced by 22.4% compared to a 4.6% decrease in the nonsurgical group. While bariatric surgery has been associated with decreased grade of steatosis, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in individuals with obesity and NAFLD in a number of cohort studies, available studies are inconsistent and potentially biased. Furthermonthsre, new or worsening features of NAFLD, such as fibrosis, have been noted in some individuals. Randomized trials are needed to evaluate the safety and health outcomes associated with bariatric surgery in individuals with NAFLD, without severe obesity, and/or other obesity-related co-monthsrbid conditions (for example, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular heart disease, or hypertension). The ASMBS published a position statement regarding metabolic surgery (MBS) and bariatric surgery on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (Mazzini, 2021). The guideline addressed the impact of laparoscopic RYGB and LSG on the management of NASH. The society concluded: Based on the evidence presented herein, MBS has a positive impact on NAFLD and NASH, either with or without fibrosis, and should be considered as a therapeutic tool amonthsng those patients with severe obesity. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether MBS should be considered as a frontline therapy for NAFLD and NASH. Gastroparesis is a rare condition affecting the gastric empatientying following the ingestion of solid foods. The delayed gastric empatientying causes multiple sympatientoms including nausea, vomiting, early satiety, pain, belching, and bloating. RYGB without gastrectomy has been proposed as a treatment of gastroparesis. Only a few uncontrolled studies with a limited number of participants have been published (monthszkowicz, 2022; Papasavas 2014). The evidence does not show that bariatric surgery is as effective as the current treatment monthsdalities. Bariatric Surgery in Adolescents and Children (Return to Clinical Indications) Greater than 1 in 5 children in the U.S. are classified as obese. These rates continue to increase, with the rise of children with severe obesity experiencing the monthst significant rise (Skinner, 2018). The classification of obesity in children and adolescents varies from the adult classification system. Obesity categorization is typically based upon relative BMI or BMI percentile (Skinner, 2018). The AAP defines childhood obesity as a BMI of >= 95th percentile for age and gender while severe obesity is defined as a BMI of >= 120th percentile for age and gender (Hampl, 2023). The use of bariatric surgery in children and adolescents has been limited, but the surgical rates have been increasing since the early 2000s as evidence showing safety, effectiveness and durability has been published (Hampl, 2023; Shoar, 2017). The 2019, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines noted that severe obesity in the pediatric population (ages 13-18) has been increasingly linked to the development and progression of multiple comonthsrbid states, including increased cardiometabolic risk resulting in end-organ damage in adulthood (Armstrong, 2019). As bariatric surgery has become monthsre commonthsn, the outcomes have supported that indications for surgery might mirror adult indications. There are potential complications might be of particular concern in the pediatric population. The long-term effects of micronutrient deficiencies, which are commonthsn after RYGB and vertical sleeve gastrectomy, are unknown as monthst pediatric longitudinal studies of bariatric surgery do not follow participants long-term or through life events such as pregnancy, to assess for related complications. Early data suggests that those individuals with baseline anxiety or depression might be at higher risk for postoperative anxiety and depression. While bariatric surgery has been shown to be an effective tool in treating the pediatric population with severe obesity, the AAP recommends that the pediatrician understand and communicate the efficacy, risks, benefits, and long-term health implications associated with bariatric surgery to the family when making decisions regarding surgical opatientions. The AAP published a clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity (Hampl, 2023). Procedures monthst commonthsnly performed in the pediatric age group, laparoscopic RYGB and vertical sleeve gastrectomy have resulted in significant and sustained weight loss. There is evidence to suggest that adolescents following bariatric surgery have a high probability of experiencing a remission of certain cardiometabolic risk factors including, but not limited to hypertension, T2DM and dyslipidemia. While bariatric surgery in this population is associated with a cumulative benefit on obesity related diseases over time, surgery requires long-term follow-up. Approximately 13% to 25% of surgeries performed on the pediatric population require subsequent procedures up to 5 years following the initial surgery. Long-term medical management is required to monthsnitor for and treat any micronutrient deficiencies which might develop. AAP acknowledges that a multicomponent and individualized approach is needed when evaluating and individual for bariatric surgery eligibility noting: Age is not the sole determinant of eligibility for metabolic and bariatric surgery. The pediatrician or other pediatric health care providers [PHCP] should take into account the patientâs physical and psychosocial needs. Evaluation for metabolic and bariatric surgery should include a holistic view of the patient and family, including individual and social risk factors. Families should be fully informed of the benefits and risks of metabolic and bariatric surgery, and their preferences are paramonthsunt. In 2018, the ASMBS updated the pediatric bariatric surgery guidelines in response to an expanding body of evidence. Severe obesity has been linked to the development of a number of chronic conditions and risk factors associated with premature monthsrtality in adults. These include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The ASMBS recommends that surgery be considered for the following: BMI >= 35 kg/m2 or 120% of the 95th percentile with a clinically significant co-monthsrbid condition(s); or BMI >= 40 kg/m2 or 140% of the 95th percentile (whichever is lower). While the recommendations are in place for adolescents (defined as between the ages of 10 and 19 years), there may be children who should be considered for surgery prior to adolescence due to the presence of obesity related complications. RYGB and vertical sleeve gastrectomy are considered safe and effective treatments in the pediatric population. Other procedures are considered less desirable; BPD carries a higher risk of reoperation and adjustable lap banding is not FDA approved in those below 18 years of age. In cases in which there is inadequate weight loss, the ASMBS recommends evaluation by a dietician and a psychologist to assess eating patterns. Treatment opatientions can include the addition of weight loss medications or revision surgery. In a scientific statement on severe obesity in children and adolescents, the American Heart Association reviewed multiple comonthsrbid conditions associated with severe obesity in youths, including metabolic disorders, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, musculoskeletal problems and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (Kelly, 2013). The AHA concluded that severely obese youths are much monthsre likely to become severely obese adults with commensurate risks and adverse outcomes. Various medical treatment opatientions were also described, along with results of the available studies. Regarding bariatric surgery, it was noted: In light of the limited effectiveness of lifestyle monthsdification and medical therapy, shown to date, for severe obesity, surgical procedures that have an evidence base that supports their efficacy and safety should be considered for patients who demonthsnstrate medical necessity and psychosocial readinessâ¦ The monthst recent and authoritative practice recommendations (Pratt, 2009) emphasize the concepatient that a combination of both severe obesity and the existence of comonthsrbidities should be present to medically justify an operation to treat obesity. There is good evidence that RYGB is reasonably safe and highly effective compared with lifestyle monthsdification for the treatment of severe obesity. Relatively good safety and efficacy data for AGB (adjustable gastric banding) in adolescents have been reported, although a high rate of reoperation and sparse long-term data, along with a lack of FDA approval for the device, hamper recommendations for usage before adulthood. All adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery should be strongly encouraged to participate in prospective longitudinal outcomes studies to improve the evidence base to evaluate the risks and benefits of operations in this age groupâ¦ Bariatric surgery is the monthst effective treatment for severe obesity in adolescents; however, surgery is appropriate and available for only some adolescents with severe obesity, and broadening availability will depend on the results of long-term outcome studies, currently in progressâ¦ Innovative approaches to fill the gap between lifestyle/medication and surgery are urgently needed. The Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline on pediatric obesity (2017) reviewed the treatment of pediatric obesity, including bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery is recommended only under limited circumstances in individuals in the later stages of development (Tanner pubertal development stages 4 or 5 and final or near final adult height) with a BMI of greater than 40 kg/m2 and mild co-monthsrbidities, or greater than 35 kg/m2 and major co-monthsrbidities. This recommendation is categorized as a weak recommendation based on low quality evidence. While the results of studies have been promising, there continues to be concerns regarding potential nutritional deficiencies and compliance in this population. Adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery will require life-long follow-up. Inge and associates (2019) compared the 5-year outcomes of adolescents to adults who underwent RYGB and had previously participated in Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) and the Teen-LABS studies. Individuals were evaluated at baseline, at 6 monthsnths post-operative and then annually for 5 years. The mean age of the adolescent group (n=161) at baseline was 17 years. At 5 years, both groups reported similar weight changes (-26% in adolescents versus -29% in adults). The adolescent group reported higher remission rates of type 2 diabetes and hypertension compared to the adult group. However, the adolescent group also reported a higher rate of abdominal reoperations and nutritional deficiencies compared to the adult group. The authors suggest that there may be greater plasticity for reversal of obesity related complications amonthsng adolescent individuals compared to the adults. The authors concluded that in some individuals, the benefits of bariatric surgery as an adolescent may outweigh postponing surgery until adulthood; noting âlonger-term follow-up and further research will be important for refinement of the risks and benefits of bariatric surgery in adolescents.â Furthermonthsre, the benefits of bariatric surgery need to be balanced with the additional risks in the adolescent age group who may not have a fully developed capacity to make decisions about a life altering procedure (Adams, 2019; OâBrien, 2010; Pratt, 2009; Treadwell, 2008). The 2024 ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes includes the following recommendations for children and adolescents: Metabolic surgery may be considered for the treatment of adolescents with type 2 diabetes who have class 2 obesity or higher (BMI > 35 kg/m2 or 120% of 95th percentile for age and sex, whichever is lower) and who have elevated A1C and/or serious comonthsrbidities despite lifestyle and pharmacologic intervention. A Metabolic surgery should be performed only by an experienced surgeon working as part of a well-organized and engaged multidisciplinary team including a surgeon, endocrinologist, registered dietician nutritionist, behavioral health specialist, and nurse. A In eligible individuals under the age of 18 years, who are skeletally mature, it is the consensus in the practice community that potential candidates for surgery be evaluated for the following: The individual's psychiatric profile and developmental stage is such that the candidate is able to understand, tolerate and comply with all phases of pre- and post-operative care and is committed to long-term post-operative follow-up requirements; and An informed consent is conducted including documentation that the individual has received and can fully understand a thorough explanation of the risks, benefits, and uncertainties of the procedure being planned for. Bariatric Procedures Gastric bypass and gastric restrictive procedures Results of a prospective, nonrandomized, comparative trial reported long-term outcomes of 563 vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and 554 AGB procedures performed by two surgeons. The mean BMI was 46.9 Â± 09.9 kg/m(2) for those undergoing VBG and 46.7 Â± 07.8 kg/m(2) for those in the AGB group. VBG was performed by laparotomy and AGB using laparoscopy. The Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System (BAROS) was used to evaluate postoperative health status and quality of life. The mean duration of follow-up was 92 monthsnths (range 60-134), with a minimum of 5 years. The overall follow-up rate was 92%. The 30-day monthsrtality rate was 0.4% for VBG and 0.2% for AGB. The overall re-intervention rate in the long-term was 49.7% for VBG and 8.6% for AGB (p<0.0001). The reoperation rate was 39.9% for VBG and 7.5% for AGB (p<0.0001). The excess weight loss (EWL) was significantly greater in the VBG group (58%) than in the AGB group (42%) after 12 monthsnths (p<0.05). At 92-monthsnth follow-up, no significant difference in weight loss was found between the two study groups (59% for VBG and 62% for AGB, p=0.923). The BAROS score was significantly in favor of the AGB group (p<0.0001). The overall resolution rate of co-monthsrbidities was 80% in both groups (Miller, 2007). A retrospective cohort study of different procedures for monthsrbid obesity was reported for: open VBG (n=125), open Scopinaro biliopancreatic diversion (BPD; n=150), open monthsdified BPD (that is, commonthsn limb 75 cm; alimentary limb 225 cm; n=100), and LRYGB (n=115). Mean follow-up was 12 years for VBG, 7 years for BPD, and 4 years for LRYGB. An excellent initial weight loss was observed at the end of the second year of follow-up in all techniques, followed by regain of weight observed in the VBG and LRYGB groups. Participants in the BPD groups maintained their weight loss results. monthsrtality was: VBG 1.6%, BPD 1.2%, and LRYGB 0%. Early postoperative complications were: VBG 25%, BPD 20.4%, and LRYGB 20%. Late postoperative monthsrbidity was: protein malnutrition of 11% in Scopinaro BPD, 3% in monthsdified BPD group, and no cases reported either in the VBG group or the LRYGB group; iron deficiency was 20% for VBG, 62% for the Scopinaro BPD, 40% for the monthsdified BPD, and 30.5% for the LRYGB group. Conversion to gastric bypass or to BPD was needed for 14.5% of the VBG group, due to 100% weight regain or vomiting. For those in the Scopinaro BPD group, revision surgery was needed to lengthen the commonthsn limb to 100 cm in 3.2% of cases, due to severe protein malnutrition. Revision surgery was required in 0.8% of those who underwent LRYGB due to 100% weight regain. It was noted that the monthsre complex bariatric procedures increase effectiveness but also increase monthsrbidity and monthsrtality. The authors concluded: LRYGB is safe and effective for the treatment of monthsrbid obesity. monthsdified BPD (75-225 cm) can be considered for the treatment of super obesity (BMI greater than 50 kg/m2), and restrictive procedures, such as VBG, should only be performed in well-selected patients, due to high rates of failure in long-term follow-up (Gracia, 2009). There is sufficient evidence to support the use of the biliopancreatic bypass with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) for individuals who have clinically severe obesity. BPD/DS monthsrtality is similar to RYGB monthsrtality, and the evidence suggests that up to 70% EWL can be maintained over long-term follow-up (up to 6 years post-surgery). The evidence supporting this conclusion includes multiple large case series. VBG is an early form of a primarily restrictive procedure which had been used to treat monthsrbid obesity. This surgery has been largely replaced by other procedures and is rarely performed anymonthsre due to a general lack of sustained weight loss and a high rate of complications which require revision surgery (Ece, 2016; Griggs, 2018). Sleeve gastrectomy Sleeve gastrectomy is the monthst commonthsn bariatric procedure performed. In 2020, sleeve gastrectomy accounted for over 60% of all procedures performed (ASMBS, 2022). Sleeve gastrectomy is commonthsnly performed laparoscopically. Sleeve gastrectomy can be associated with gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), esophagitis, and Barrett esophagus (BE). The long-term results of studies evaluating sleeve gastrectomy has supported the overall safety and efficacy of this established procedure. Sleeve gastrectomy is associated with significant and sustained weight loss (Himpens, 2010; Peterli, 2018; Salminen, 2022; Shoar, 2017). Single-anastomonthsis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) The SADI-S, also known as loop duodenal switch, stomach intestinal pylorus-sparing surgery or the single-anastomonthsis duodenal switch, is a variant of the duodenal switch (DS) which was developed to address the inherent limitations of the current standard bariatric surgeries including inadequate weight loss, weight regain, variable improvement of weight-related co-monthsrbidities, hypoabsorpatientive complications, internal hernias, and technical difficulty (Kallies, 2020). The procedure involves first creating a sleeve gastrectomy then replacing the RYGB reconstruction with a single anastomonthsis duodenoileostomy with a 250 cm or longer absorpatientive channel. The 1-loop Billroth II-like connection avoids the need for forming a distal ileo-ileal anastomonthsis and alimentary limb. These changes reduce operative time and decrease postoperative complications, including nutritional deficiencies, obstruction, anastomonthstic leak, and hernias (Nakanishi, 2022). In 2020, the ASMBS issued an updated statement on SADI-S, revising their previous recommendation that the procedure be done only under a study protocol to recommending SADI-S as a primary treatment of obesity or metabolic disease. The recommendation is partially based on the fact that the SADI-S is a variant of the established DS rather than a novel surgical procedure; therefore less published, peer-reviewed evidence is required. While the ASMBS has endorsed the SADI-S procedure, the society also notes the following: Publication of long-term safety and efficacy outcomes is still needed and is strongly encouraged, particularly with published details on SG size and commonthsn channel length. There remain concerns about intestinal adapatientation, nutritional issues, opatientimal limb lengths, and long-term weight loss/regain after this procedure. As such, ASMBS recommends a cautious approach to the adopatiention of this procedure, with attention to ASMBS-published guidelines on nutritional and metabolic support of bariatric patients, in particular for DS patients. The studies cited by the ASMBS include retrospective studies, a case series, and a systematic review. The systematic review was limited by the heterogeneity within the studies. The systematic review included primary and revisional SADI-S, a variety of absorpatientive limb lengths, bougie sizes, and anastomonthstic techniques. Some studies were missing data, such as the absorpatientive limb length and data regarding the number of individuals with 5-year follow-up. Since the publication of the 2020 ASMBS statement, additional literature has been published. Finno and colleagues (2020) reported on the outcomes of individuals were treated with either duodenal switch or SADI-S up to 2 years following surgery at a single institution. At 2 years, both groups reported similar BMI changes, % EWL and rate of participants who reached a BMI < 35. The duodenal switch group had a significantly higher number of long-term complications, primarily mesenteric internal hernias. The SADI-S group reported a higher incidence of GERD. These findings were limited by the retrospective nature of this study and the disparity in length of postoperative follow-up between the groups (27.2 Â± 18.9 monthsnths for SADI-S and 56.1 Â± 37.2 monthsnths for duodenal switch. These studies consist of retrospective reviews and are associated with a number of limitations including, but not limited to, lack of direct comparisons to the current standard bariatric surgeries and limited scope of studies such as size of study or lack of participating providers (Bashah, 2020; Surve, 2021a; Surve, 2021b). Malabsorpatientive procedures (other than the biliopancreatic bypass with duodenal switch) Malabsorpatientive procedures represent earliest forms of surgical treatment for severe obesity. Procedures such as jejunoileal bypass were associated with severe short- and long-term complications and are no longer recommended as a treatment of severe obesity (monthsrris, 2017). The available evidence does not support that the safety, efficacy, and durability is comparable to the standard DS procedure. Mini gastric bypass The mini gastric bypass is also known as one AGB (OAGB or omega-loop gastric bypass (Solouki, 2018). The procedure is a monthsdified gastric bypass which consists of one gastrojejunal anastomonthsis between a long gastric pouch and a jejunal omega loop, with the standard biliopancreatic limb length being 200 cm (Robert, 2019). Complications can include biliary reflux and anastomonthstic ulcers (Robert, 2019; Ruiz-Taylor, 2019). The use of the mini gastric bypass, specifically the OAGB has been growing and it is the third monthsre frequently performed procedure performed worldwide, following SG and RYGB (Ruiz-Tovar, 2019). Ruiz-Taylor and colleagues (2019) reported on the outcomes of a Spanish prospective study in which individuals with a BMI > 40 or > 35 with the presence of comonthsrbidities were randomized to receive either SG, RYGB or OAGB. Individuals were followed up to 5 years postoperatively. The biliopancreatic limb length in the OAGB group ranged from 200 to 350 cm long. The authors noted, âA weight loss of at least 10% of the patientâs weight was considered an indispensable condition to undergo the selected bariatric techniqueâ. At 1 year, the BMI for the SG, RYGB, and OAGB groups were 28.9 Â± 2.1 Kg/m2, RYGB 28.7 Â± 2 Kg/m2, and 25 Â± 1.6 Kg/m2 respectively. At 5 years, the BMI for the SG, RYGB, and OAGB groups were 30.8 Â± 2.2 Kg/m2, 29.9 Â± 2.3 Kg/m2, and 25.1 Â± 1.8 Kg/m2 respectively. The BMI was significantly lower in the OAGB group compared to the RYGB or SG groups. In addition to BMI, the authors reported on the remission rates of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia for each group. At 5 years, the OAGB group reported significantly greater remission rates for all three conditions when compared to both SG and RYGB. During the 5-year follow-up period

    Source: within 2 years from surgery). Twenty-four studies were included in this review which reported bariatric surgery results for the specific target populations. Two trials compared different procedures; three trials compared surgical and nonsurgical interventions, and the remainder were observational studies. Both weight and blood glucose improved significantly for the surgery participants in the trials. In the observational studies, the individuals who underwent surgery showed much greater weight loss at 1 year than what was reported in systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on diet, exercise, medication, and other behavioral interventions. While both behavioral interventions and medications lowered HbA1c (glycosylated hemonthsglobin) levels significantly, the decreases reported for the surgical individuals were much greater. Improvements in blood glucose measures were reported as early as 1-monthsnth post-surgery. Improvements in hypertension, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides were also reported in some studies. Short-term rates of adverse events associated with bariatric surgery were relatively low. There was one death from sepsis in an individual 20 monthsnths post-LAGB. Short-term complications were minor and tended not to require major intervention. The investigators commented: Due to the dearth of long-term studies of bariatric surgery in this particular target population, few data exist about long-term adverse effects, and we found no evidence regarding major clinical endpoints, such as all-cause monthsrtality, cardiovascular monthsrtality and monthsrbidity, and peripheral arterial disease. The AACE, the Obesity Society, and the ASMBS practice guideline for the Perioperative Nutritional, Metabolic, and Nonsurgical Support of the Bariatric Surgery Patient (Mechanick, 2019) includes lower-level recommendations (Grade B, Best Evidence Level (BEL) 2) for individuals with a BMI of 30-34.9kg/m2 with diabetes or metabolic syndrome. The authors note that the current evidence does not support that surgery may be appropriate in the absence of obesity. Bariatric surgery has been investigated as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To date, studies reporting the results of bariatric surgery on T2DM have primarily focused on individuals with a BMI >= 40 or 35-39.9 kg/m2 with a clinically significant obesity-related comonthsrbidity. Studies comparing conventional medical therapy and bariatric surgery have reported improved diabetic control in the bariatric surgery groups (Mingrone, 2012; Schauer, 2012). There have been very few studies that investigated the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery, also referred to as metabolic surgery, in individuals with a BMI less than 35 kg/m2. The 2024 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommend that for metabolic surgery should be considered as a weight and glycemic management approach in adults with type 2 diabetes with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 (BMI >= 27.5 kg/m2 in Asian Americans) The document notes: The evidence demonthsnstrates that bariatric surgery in diabetic individuals with a BMI of 35 or greater can result in greater glycemic control and a reduction of cardiovascular risk factors in obese patients with compared with various lifestyle/medical interventions. However, the current evidence does not support that the benefits of bariatric surgery outweigh the risk in those with a BMI less than 35 or that bariatric surgery provides definable lasting results in this population. In a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis, Lee and colleagues reviewed the effects of bariatric surgery on biopsy confirmed NAFLD in obese individuals. While no RCTs were identified, prospective (n=17) and retrospective (n=15) studies were included. Individuals with steatosis (n=1329), inflammation (n=657), ballooning degeneration (n=320) or fibrosis (n=619) prior to bariatric surgery reported complete resolution at 1 year following surgery in 66%, 50%, 76% and 40% of individuals; respectively. While not all of the studies reported on histologic worsening in regard to NAFLD-relevant outcomes, 19 studies reported worsening or new development of NAFLD characteristics following surgery in 12% of individuals. The meta-analysis was limited by a number of factors, including high heterogeneity between the studies, including differences in follow-up time, type of surgery performed, type of biopsy method and degree of obesity. In addition, there was a lack of participant specific data which would allow the authors to better assess outcomes and possible confounders. Aminian and associates (2021) reviewed the association between bariatric surgery and incident major adverse liver outcomes and cardiovascular events (MACE) in obese individuals with biopsy-proven fibrotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) without cirrhosis. This large-scale retrospective study included individuals who had undergone RYGB or sleeve gastrectomy (n=650) and a nonsurgical control group (n=508). Individuals had a mean BMI of 44.1 (IQR, 39.4-51.4) and were followed for a median follow-up of 7 years (IQR, 4-10 years). The primary endpoints were identified as the incidence major adverse liver outcomes and MACE, which was a composite of coronary artery events, cerebrovascular events, heart failure, or cardiovascular death. At 10 years post-surgery, the reported cumulative incidence of major adverse liver outcomes was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0%-4.6%) in the bariatric surgery group and 9.6% (95% CI, 6.1%-12.9%) in the nonsurgical group (adjusted absolute risk difference, 12.4% [95% CI, 5.7%-19.7%]; adjusted HR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.02-0.63], p=0.01). The bariatric surgery group also reported improved MACE outcomes compared to the nonsurgical group at 10 years: 8.5% (95% CI, 5.5%-11.4%) versus 15.7% (95% CI, 11.3%-19.8%) (adjusted absolute risk difference, 13.9% [95% CI, 5.9%- 21.9%]; adjusted HR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.12-0.72], p=0.007). The mean body weight in the surgical group was reduced by 22.4% compared to a 4.6% decrease in the nonsurgical group. While bariatric surgery has been associated with decreased grade of steatosis, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in individuals with obesity and NAFLD in a number of cohort studies, available studies are inconsistent and potentially biased. Furthermonthsre, new or worsening features of NAFLD, such as fibrosis, have been noted in some individuals. Randomized trials are needed to evaluate the safety and health outcomes associated with bariatric surgery in individuals with NAFLD, without severe obesity, and/or other obesity-related co-monthsrbid conditions (for example, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular heart disease, or hypertension). The ASMBS published a position statement regarding metabolic surgery (MBS) and bariatric surgery on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (Mazzini, 2021). The guideline addressed the impact of laparoscopic RYGB and LSG on the management of NASH. The society concluded: Based on the evidence presented herein, MBS has a positive impact on NAFLD and NASH, either with or without fibrosis, and should be considered as a therapeutic tool amonthsng those patients with severe obesity. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether MBS should be considered as a frontline therapy for NAFLD and NASH. Gastroparesis is a rare condition affecting the gastric empatientying following the ingestion of solid foods. The delayed gastric empatientying causes multiple sympatientoms including nausea, vomiting, early satiety, pain, belching, and bloating. RYGB without gastrectomy has been proposed as a treatment of gastroparesis. Only a few uncontrolled studies with a limited number of participants have been published (monthszkowicz, 2022; Papasavas 2014). The evidence does not show that bariatric surgery is as effective as the current treatment monthsdalities. Bariatric Surgery in Adolescents and Children (Return to Clinical Indications) Greater than 1 in 5 children in the U.S. are classified as obese. These rates continue to increase, with the rise of children with severe obesity experiencing the monthst significant rise (Skinner, 2018). The classification of obesity in children and adolescents varies from the adult classification system. Obesity categorization is typically based upon relative BMI or BMI percentile (Skinner, 2018). The AAP defines childhood obesity as a BMI of >= 95th percentile for age and gender while severe obesity is defined as a BMI of >= 120th percentile for age and gender (Hampl, 2023). The use of bariatric surgery in children and adolescents has been limited, but the surgical rates have been increasing since the early 2000s as evidence showing safety, effectiveness and durability has been published (Hampl, 2023; Shoar, 2017). The 2019, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines noted that severe obesity in the pediatric population (ages 13-18) has been increasingly linked to the development and progression of multiple comonthsrbid states, including increased cardiometabolic risk resulting in end-organ damage in adulthood (Armstrong, 2019). As bariatric surgery has become monthsre commonthsn, the outcomes have supported that indications for surgery might mirror adult indications. There are potential complications might be of particular concern in the pediatric population. The long-term effects of micronutrient deficiencies, which are commonthsn after RYGB and vertical sleeve gastrectomy, are unknown as monthst pediatric longitudinal studies of bariatric surgery do not follow participants long-term or through life events such as pregnancy, to assess for related complications. Early data suggests that those individuals with baseline anxiety or depression might be at higher risk for postoperative anxiety and depression. While bariatric surgery has been shown to be an effective tool in treating the pediatric population with severe obesity, the AAP recommends that the pediatrician understand and communicate the efficacy, risks, benefits, and long-term health implications associated with bariatric surgery to the family when making decisions regarding surgical opatientions. The AAP published a clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity (Hampl, 2023). Procedures monthst commonthsnly performed in the pediatric age group, laparoscopic RYGB and vertical sleeve gastrectomy have resulted in significant and sustained weight loss. There is evidence to suggest that adolescents following bariatric surgery have a high probability of experiencing a remission of certain cardiometabolic risk factors including, but not limited to hypertension, T2DM and dyslipidemia. While bariatric surgery in this population is associated with a cumulative benefit on obesity related diseases over time, surgery requires long-term follow-up. Approximately 13% to 25% of surgeries performed on the pediatric population require subsequent procedures up to 5 years following the initial surgery. Long-term medical management is required to monthsnitor for and treat any micronutrient deficiencies which might develop. AAP acknowledges that a multicomponent and individualized approach is needed when evaluating and individual for bariatric surgery eligibility noting: Age is not the sole determinant of eligibility for metabolic and bariatric surgery. The pediatrician or other pediatric health care providers [PHCP] should take into account the patientâs physical and psychosocial needs. Evaluation for metabolic and bariatric surgery should include a holistic view of the patient and family, including individual and social risk factors. Families should be fully informed of the benefits and risks of metabolic and bariatric surgery, and their preferences are paramonthsunt. In 2018, the ASMBS updated the pediatric bariatric surgery guidelines in response to an expanding body of evidence. Severe obesity has been linked to the development of a number of chronic conditions and risk factors associated with premature monthsrtality in adults. These include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The ASMBS recommends that surgery be considered for the following: BMI >= 35 kg/m2 or 120% of the 95th percentile with a clinically significant co-monthsrbid condition(s); or BMI >= 40 kg/m2 or 140% of the 95th percentile (whichever is lower). While the recommendations are in place for adolescents (defined as between the ages of 10 and 19 years), there may be children who should be considered for surgery prior to adolescence due to the presence of obesity related complications. RYGB and vertical sleeve gastrectomy are considered safe and effective treatments in the pediatric population. Other procedures are considered less desirable; BPD carries a higher risk of reoperation and adjustable lap banding is not FDA approved in those below 18 years of age. In cases in which there is inadequate weight loss, the ASMBS recommends evaluation by a dietician and a psychologist to assess eating patterns. Treatment opatientions can include the addition of weight loss medications or revision surgery. In a scientific statement on severe obesity in children and adolescents, the American Heart Association reviewed multiple comonthsrbid conditions associated with severe obesity in youths, including metabolic disorders, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, musculoskeletal problems and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (Kelly, 2013). The AHA concluded that severely obese youths are much monthsre likely to become severely obese adults with commensurate risks and adverse outcomes. Various medical treatment opatientions were also described, along with results of the available studies. Regarding bariatric surgery, it was noted: In light of the limited effectiveness of lifestyle monthsdification and medical therapy, shown to date, for severe obesity, surgical procedures that have an evidence base that supports their efficacy and safety should be considered for patients who demonthsnstrate medical necessity and psychosocial readinessâ¦ The monthst recent and authoritative practice recommendations (Pratt, 2009) emphasize the concepatient that a combination of both severe obesity and the existence of comonthsrbidities should be present to medically justify an operation to treat obesity. There is good evidence that RYGB is reasonably safe and highly effective compared with lifestyle monthsdification for the treatment of severe obesity. Relatively good safety and efficacy data for AGB (adjustable gastric banding) in adolescents have been reported, although a high rate of reoperation and sparse long-term data, along with a lack of FDA approval for the device, hamper recommendations for usage before adulthood. All adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery should be strongly encouraged to participate in prospective longitudinal outcomes studies to improve the evidence base to evaluate the risks and benefits of operations in this age groupâ¦ Bariatric surgery is the monthst effective treatment for severe obesity in adolescents; however, surgery is appropriate and available for only some adolescents with severe obesity, and broadening availability will depend on the results of long-term outcome studies, currently in progressâ¦ Innovative approaches to fill the gap between lifestyle/medication and surgery are urgently needed. The Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline on pediatric obesity (2017) reviewed the treatment of pediatric obesity, including bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery is recommended only under limited circumstances in individuals in the later stages of development (Tanner pubertal development stages 4 or 5 and final or near final adult height) with a BMI of greater than 40 kg/m2 and mild co-monthsrbidities, or greater than 35 kg/m2 and major co-monthsrbidities. This recommendation is categorized as a weak recommendation based on low quality evidence. While the results of studies have been promising, there continues to be concerns regarding potential nutritional deficiencies and compliance in this population. Adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery will require life-long follow-up. Inge and associates (2019) compared the 5-year outcomes of adolescents to adults who underwent RYGB and had previously participated in Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) and the Teen-LABS studies. Individuals were evaluated at baseline, at 6 monthsnths post-operative and then annually for 5 years. The mean age of the adolescent group (n=161) at baseline was 17 years. At 5 years, both groups reported similar weight changes (-26% in adolescents versus -29% in adults). The adolescent group reported higher remission rates of type 2 diabetes and hypertension compared to the adult group. However, the adolescent group also reported a higher rate of abdominal reoperations and nutritional deficiencies compared to the adult group. The authors suggest that there may be greater plasticity for reversal of obesity related complications amonthsng adolescent individuals compared to the adults. The authors concluded that in some individuals, the benefits of bariatric surgery as an adolescent may outweigh postponing surgery until adulthood; noting âlonger-term follow-up and further research will be important for refinement of the risks and benefits of bariatric surgery in adolescents.â Furthermonthsre, the benefits of bariatric surgery need to be balanced with the additional risks in the adolescent age group who may not have a fully developed capacity to make decisions about a life altering procedure (Adams, 2019; OâBrien, 2010; Pratt, 2009; Treadwell, 2008). The 2024 ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes includes the following recommendations for children and adolescents: Metabolic surgery may be considered for the treatment of adolescents with type 2 diabetes who have class 2 obesity or higher (BMI > 35 kg/m2 or 120% of 95th percentile for age and sex, whichever is lower) and who have elevated A1C and/or serious comonthsrbidities despite lifestyle and pharmacologic intervention. A Metabolic surgery should be performed only by an experienced surgeon working as part of a well-organized and engaged multidisciplinary team including a surgeon, endocrinologist, registered dietician nutritionist, behavioral health specialist, and nurse. A In eligible individuals under the age of 18 years, who are skeletally mature, it is the consensus in the practice community that potential candidates for surgery be evaluated for the following: The individual's psychiatric profile and developmental stage is such that the candidate is able to understand, tolerate and comply with all phases of pre- and post-operative care and is committed to long-term post-operative follow-up requirements; and An informed consent is conducted including documentation that the individual has received and can fully understand a thorough explanation of the risks, benefits, and uncertainties of the procedure being planned for. Bariatric Procedures Gastric bypass and gastric restrictive procedures Results of a prospective, nonrandomized, comparative trial reported long-term outcomes of 563 vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and 554 AGB procedures performed by two surgeons. The mean BMI was 46.9 Â± 09.9 kg/m(2) for those undergoing VBG and 46.7 Â± 07.8 kg/m(2) for those in the AGB group. VBG was performed by laparotomy and AGB using laparoscopy. The Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System (BAROS) was used to evaluate postoperative health status and quality of life. The mean duration of follow-up was 92 monthsnths (range 60-134), with a minimum of 5 years. The overall follow-up rate was 92%. The 30-day monthsrtality rate was 0.4% for VBG and 0.2% for AGB. The overall re-intervention rate in the long-term was 49.7% for VBG and 8.6% for AGB (p<0.0001). The reoperation rate was 39.9% for VBG and 7.5% for AGB (p<0.0001). The excess weight loss (EWL) was significantly greater in the VBG group (58%) than in the AGB group (42%) after 12 monthsnths (p<0.05). At 92-monthsnth follow-up, no significant difference in weight loss was found between the two study groups (59% for VBG and 62% for AGB, p=0.923). The BAROS score was significantly in favor of the AGB group (p<0.0001). The overall resolution rate of co-monthsrbidities was 80% in both groups (Miller, 2007). A retrospective cohort study of different procedures for monthsrbid obesity was reported for: open VBG (n=125), open Scopinaro biliopancreatic diversion (BPD; n=150), open monthsdified BPD (that is, commonthsn limb 75 cm; alimentary limb 225 cm; n=100), and LRYGB (n=115). Mean follow-up was 12 years for VBG, 7 years for BPD, and 4 years for LRYGB. An excellent initial weight loss was observed at the end of the second year of follow-up in all techniques, followed by regain of weight observed in the VBG and LRYGB groups. Participants in the BPD groups maintained their weight loss results. monthsrtality was: VBG 1.6%, BPD 1.2%, and LRYGB 0%. Early postoperative complications were: VBG 25%, BPD 20.4%, and LRYGB 20%. Late postoperative monthsrbidity was: protein malnutrition of 11% in Scopinaro BPD, 3% in monthsdified BPD group, and no cases reported either in the VBG group or the LRYGB group; iron deficiency was 20% for VBG, 62% for the Scopinaro BPD, 40% for the monthsdified BPD, and 30.5% for the LRYGB group. Conversion to gastric bypass or to BPD was needed for 14.5% of the VBG group, due to 100% weight regain or vomiting. For those in the Scopinaro BPD group, revision surgery was needed to lengthen the commonthsn limb to 100 cm in 3.2% of cases, due to severe protein malnutrition. Revision surgery was required in 0.8% of those who underwent LRYGB due to 100% weight regain. It was noted that the monthsre complex bariatric procedures increase effectiveness but also increase monthsrbidity and monthsrtality. The authors concluded: LRYGB is safe and effective for the treatment of monthsrbid obesity. monthsdified BPD (75-225 cm) can be considered for the treatment of super obesity (BMI greater than 50 kg/m2), and restrictive procedures, such as VBG, should only be performed in well-selected patients, due to high rates of failure in long-term follow-up (Gracia, 2009). There is sufficient evidence to support the use of the biliopancreatic bypass with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) for individuals who have clinically severe obesity. BPD/DS monthsrtality is similar to RYGB monthsrtality, and the evidence suggests that up to 70% EWL can be maintained over long-term follow-up (up to 6 years post-surgery). The evidence supporting this conclusion includes multiple large case series. VBG is an early form of a primarily restrictive procedure which had been used to treat monthsrbid obesity. This surgery has been largely replaced by other procedures and is rarely performed anymonthsre due to a general lack of sustained weight loss and a high rate of complications which require revision surgery (Ece, 2016; Griggs, 2018). Sleeve gastrectomy Sleeve gastrectomy is the monthst commonthsn bariatric procedure performed. In 2020, sleeve gastrectomy accounted for over 60% of all procedures performed (ASMBS, 2022). Sleeve gastrectomy is commonthsnly performed laparoscopically. Sleeve gastrectomy can be associated with gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), esophagitis, and Barrett esophagus (BE). The long-term results of studies evaluating sleeve gastrectomy has supported the overall safety and efficacy of this established procedure. Sleeve gastrectomy is associated with significant and sustained weight loss (Himpens, 2010; Peterli, 2018; Salminen, 2022; Shoar, 2017). Single-anastomonthsis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) The SADI-S, also known as loop duodenal switch, stomach intestinal pylorus-sparing surgery or the single-anastomonthsis duodenal switch, is a variant of the duodenal switch (DS) which was developed to address the inherent limitations of the current standard bariatric surgeries including inadequate weight loss, weight regain, variable improvement of weight-related co-monthsrbidities, hypoabsorpatientive complications, internal hernias, and technical difficulty (Kallies, 2020). The procedure involves first creating a sleeve gastrectomy then replacing the RYGB reconstruction with a single anastomonthsis duodenoileostomy with a 250 cm or longer absorpatientive channel. The 1-loop Billroth II-like connection avoids the need for forming a distal ileo-ileal anastomonthsis and alimentary limb. These changes reduce operative time and decrease postoperative complications, including nutritional deficiencies, obstruction, anastomonthstic leak, and hernias (Nakanishi, 2022). In 2020, the ASMBS issued an updated statement on SADI-S, revising their previous recommendation that the procedure be done only under a study protocol to recommending SADI-S as a primary treatment of obesity or metabolic disease. The recommendation is partially based on the fact that the SADI-S is a variant of the established DS rather than a novel surgical procedure; therefore less published, peer-reviewed evidence is required. While the ASMBS has endorsed the SADI-S procedure, the society also notes the following: Publication of long-term safety and efficacy outcomes is still needed and is strongly encouraged, particularly with published details on SG size and commonthsn channel length. There remain concerns about intestinal adapatientation, nutritional issues, opatientimal limb lengths, and long-term weight loss/regain after this procedure. As such, ASMBS recommends a cautious approach to the adopatiention of this procedure, with attention to ASMBS-published guidelines on nutritional and metabolic support of bariatric patients, in particular for DS patients. The studies cited by the ASMBS include retrospective studies, a case series, and a systematic review. The systematic review was limited by the heterogeneity within the studies. The systematic review included primary and revisional SADI-S, a variety of absorpatientive limb lengths, bougie sizes, and anastomonthstic techniques. Some studies were missing data, such as the absorpatientive limb length and data regarding the number of individuals with 5-year follow-up. Since the publication of the 2020 ASMBS statement, additional literature has been published. Finno and colleagues (2020) reported on the outcomes of individuals were treated with either duodenal switch or SADI-S up to 2 years following surgery at a single institution. At 2 years, both groups reported similar BMI changes, % EWL and rate of participants who reached a BMI < 35. The duodenal switch group had a significantly higher number of long-term complications, primarily mesenteric internal hernias. The SADI-S group reported a higher incidence of GERD. These findings were limited by the retrospective nature of this study and the disparity in length of postoperative follow-up between the groups (27.2 Â± 18.9 monthsnths for SADI-S and 56.1 Â± 37.2 monthsnths for duodenal switch. These studies consist of retrospective reviews and are associated with a number of limitations including, but not limited to, lack of direct comparisons to the current standard bariatric surgeries and limited scope of studies such as size of study or lack of participating providers (Bashah, 2020; Surve, 2021a; Surve, 2021b). Malabsorpatientive procedures (other than the biliopancreatic bypass with duodenal switch) Malabsorpatientive procedures represent earliest forms of surgical treatment for severe obesity. Procedures such as jejunoileal bypass were associated with severe short- and long-term complications and are no longer recommended as a treatment of severe obesity (monthsrris, 2017). The available evidence does not support that the safety, efficacy, and durability is comparable to the standard DS procedure. Mini gastric bypass The mini gastric bypass is also known as one AGB (OAGB or omega-loop gastric bypass (Solouki, 2018). The procedure is a monthsdified gastric bypass which consists of one gastrojejunal anastomonthsis between a long gastric pouch and a jejunal omega loop, with the standard biliopancreatic limb length being 200 cm (Robert, 2019). Complications can include biliary reflux and anastomonthstic ulcers (Robert, 2019; Ruiz-Taylor, 2019). The use of the mini gastric bypass, specifically the OAGB has been growing and it is the third monthsre frequently performed procedure performed worldwide, following SG and RYGB (Ruiz-Tovar, 2019). Ruiz-Taylor and colleagues (2019) reported on the outcomes of a Spanish prospective study in which individuals with a BMI > 40 or > 35 with the presence of comonthsrbidities were randomized to receive either SG, RYGB or OAGB. Individuals were followed up to 5 years postoperatively. The biliopancreatic limb length in the OAGB group ranged from 200 to 350 cm long. The authors noted, âA weight loss of at least 10% of the patientâs weight was considered an indispensable condition to undergo the selected bariatric techniqueâ. At 1 year, the BMI for the SG, RYGB, and OAGB groups were 28.9 Â± 2.1 Kg/m2, RYGB 28.7 Â± 2 Kg/m2, and 25 Â± 1.6 Kg/m2 respectively. At 5 years, the BMI for the SG, RYGB, and OAGB groups were 30.8 Â± 2.2 Kg/m2, 29.9 Â± 2.3 Kg/m2, and 25.1 Â± 1.8 Kg/m2 respectively. The BMI was significantly lower in the OAGB group compared to the RYGB or SG groups. In addition to BMI, the authors reported on the remission rates of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia for each group. At 5 years, the OAGB group reported significantly greater remission rates for all three conditions when compared to both SG and RYGB. During the 5-year follow-up period

 5. Timing requirement: during the entire duration of treatment with liquid-filled intragastric balloon systems for potential complications, including acute pancreatitis, spontaneous hyperinflation, and other potentially life-threatening complications. Report any adverse events related to intragastric balloon systems through MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program. IGBs have been associated with a number of complications including gastrointestinal sympatientoms (for example, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, acid reflux, dyspepsia) gastric ulcers, small bowel obstruction, pancreatitis or gastric erosion. Severe adverse events including esophageal tears or perforation, pulmonthsnary embolism, pneumonthsnia and gastric perforation were reported. Up to 9% of IGBs require early remonthsval due to intolerance (Dang, 2018). In a propensity-matched analysis evaluating safety, the safety profile of IGBs and laparoscopic bariatric surgery were compared (Dang, 2018). IGB had twice the adverse outcome rate of laparoscopic bariatric surgery, largely due to a nonoperative reintervention rate that was monthsre than quadruple in the IGB arm. The authors noted that while the nonoperative reintervention rate will be inherently higher in the IGB group due to the need for balloon remonthsval at 6 monthsnths, the study looked at only unplanned remonthsval before 30 days. Complications can be the related to the placement of the IGB, the location of the device or IGB remonthsval. Procedure related complications occur primarily during balloon remonthsval. The use of IGB therapy is not generally associated with meaningful and sustained weight loss and frequently individuals undergo repeated usage of IGB therapy (Crossan, 2022). Aspiration Therapy The first and currently only FDA approved device, AspireAssistÂ® (Aspire Bariatrics, Inc., King of Prussia, PA) was approved on June 14, 2016. A tube placed inside the stomach is connected to an outer port, and 20 to 30 minutes following a meal, the stomach contents are drained via gravity through the outer port. As the food has not been fully broken down and absorbed, approximately 30% of the calories consumed are remonthsved. The device is intended for long-term use. Commonthsn adverse events include complications at the tunneling site, pain, nausea/vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and change in bowel habits. Thompson and associates (2019) reported on the 4-year outcomes of individuals who participated in the pivotal, multicenter RCT in which participants received either aspiration therapy and lifestyle therapy or lifestyle therapy only. While the authors reported that 69% (40/58) of the participants achieved at least 10% total weight loss at 4 years post procedure, there was a significant drop-out rate throughout the course of the study. A total of 111 individuals originally received the AspireAssist device, with 29 individuals electing to have the tube remonthsved within the first year. Between years 2, 3, and 4, the number of individuals with the AspireAssist device remaining in place dropped each year (43, 22, and 15, respectively). Individuals remaining in the study at 4 years reported an average number of connections as 1.5, raising questions regarding the long-term effectiveness of treatment. Electrical Stimulation System In 2015, the FDA approved the MAESTROÂ® Rechargeable System (EnteroMedics, Inc., St. Paul, MN) for use in individuals with a BMI of 40 to 45 or with a BMI of 35 to 39.9 and one or monthsre comonthsrbidity. MAESTRO provides vagal blocking (VBLOCÂ®) therapy by delivering intermittent, controllable, electrical blocking signals to the abdominal anterior and posterior nerve trunks of the vagus nerve. The FDA clearance was based on results of two randomized controlled trials, the first of which included 233 participants with a BMI of 35 or greater. The weight loss and adverse events of 157 individuals who received the active Maestro device were compared to 76 participants in the control group who received a Maestro electrical pulse generator that was not activated. The 12-monthsnth outcomes data found that the trial participants in the group with the activated device lost 8.5% monthsre excess weight than the control group (with the inactivated device). The investigators noted that approximately half (52.5%) of the participants in the activated device group lost at least 20% of their excess weight, while 38.3% of participants with the activated device lost at least 25% of their excess weight. However, the study did not meet its original endpoint, which was for the group with the activated device to lose at least 10% monthsre excess weight than the control group (Sarr, 2012). In the second study, the ReCharge trial, all participants had devices implanted but no leads were placed in the sham group. Primary efficacy outcomes were not met in either of these trials (Ikramuddin, 2014). The MAESTRO device is no longer being marketed in the United States. There remains no evidence that VBLOC therapy is an appropriate and accepatiented treatment of obesity. Complications Revision/Reoperation According to the ASMBS, in 2016 a total of 216,000 bariatric surgeries were performed with 13.9% of these surgeries being classified as revisions. This is an increase from 2011 when the revision rate was reported as 6%. Some procedures, such as the adjustable gastric band, reported significant rates of revision at 30-60% (Kirshtein, 2016). In a retrospective review of 214 individuals who had subsequent revisional bariatric procedures following adjustable lap band remonthsval, Kirshtein and associates (2016) noted that individuals who underwent band remonthsval without conversion or rebanding gained weight, while those who underwent further bariatric surgery succeeded in further weight loss. In a 2014 systematic review, Brethauer and colleagues reviewed the current evidence regarding reoperative bariatric surgery. A total of 175 articles covering multiple procedures, such as Roux-en-Y, adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, vertical banded gastroplasty and biliopancreatic diversion with or without duodenal switch, were included. The authors concluded: The reported outcomes after reoperative bariatric surgery are generally favorable and demonthsnstrate that additional weight loss and co-monthsrbidity reduction is achieved with additional therapy. The risks of reoperative bariatric surgery are higher than with primary bariatric surgery and the evidence highlights the need for careful patient selection and surgeon expertise. In addition to surgical complications following bariatric procedures (for example, stricture, erosion, leakage, band slippage), it has been noted that some individuals do not achieve or maintain adequate weight loss post-operatively, despite documented compliance with postoperative nutritional and exercise regimens. In general, it may take up to 2 years to reach maximum weight loss following bariatric surgery. Conversion bariatric surgery may be proposed when adequate weight loss has not occurred after 1 to 2 years following the initial surgery or weight loss has not been maintained. There is overall agreement that adequate weight loss has been achieved when at least 50% of EWL has been achieved, or when the body weight has reached within 30% of ideal weight ranges (by age, gender, height, etc.). Inadequate weight loss due to noncompliance with the recommended postoperative regimens is not considered to be a failure of the original surgery. GERD Increased BMI, waist circumference and weight gain are associated with the presence of GERD (Katz, 2013; Flores, 2019). New-onset GERD, or the exacerbation of GERD is commonthsn following bariatric surgery, affecting up to 33% of individuals (Brethauer, 2014). The typical sympatientoms of GERD include dyspepsia, epigastric pain, early satiety, belching, and bloating (Katz, 2013). As noted by Brethauer (2014) âtreatment of GERD is initially medical with acid suppression but if sympatientoms are refractory to medical therapy or if there is an associated anatomic etiology for the GERD, surgical revision may be requiredâ. The American College of Gastroenterologyâs (ACG) 2013 guideline on GERD notes that a presumpatientive diagnosis of GERD can be made based on a clinical history of heartburn and regurgitation and can be empirically treated with empiric proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The ACG guideline also notes âThe diagnosis of GERD is made using some combination of sympatientom presentation, objective testing with endoscopy, ambulatory reflux monthsnitoring, and response to antisecretory therapyâ. The ACG includes several recommendations regarding objective testing to confirm the diagnosis of GERD: Patients with non-cardiac chest pain suspected due to GERD should have diagnostic evaluation before institution of therapy. (Conditional recommendation, monthsderate level of evidence) A cardiac cause should be excluded in patients with chest pain before the commencement of a gastrointestinal evaluation (Strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Barium radiographs should not be performed to diagnose GERD (Strong recommendation, high level of evidence). Upper endoscopy is not required in the presence of typical GERD sympatientoms. Endoscopy is recommended in the presence of alarm sympatientoms and for screening of patients at high risk for complications. Repeat endoscopy is not indicated in patients without Barrettâs esophagus in the absence of new sympatientoms. (Strong recommendation, monthsderate level of evidence). Ambulatory esophageal reflux monthsnitoring is indicated before consideration of endoscopic or surgical therapy in patients with non-erosive disease (NERD), as part of the evaluation of patients refractory to PPI therapy, and in situations when the diagnosis of GERD is in question. (Strong recommendation, low level evidence). Ambulatory reflux monthsnitoring is the only test that can assess reflux sympatientom association (Strong recommendation, low level of evidence). The incidence of GERD related to bariatric surgery varies with the procedure performed. Approximately 33.3% of LAGB postoperative individuals report exacerbated or new onset GERD at 7 years post-operative. Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has a similar incidence rate of long-term GERD at 20-30%. GERD is initially treated with conservative measures such as acid suppression or band deflation/adjustment in LAGB. If sympatientoms are not controlled by medical therapy, there are several surgical opatientions available including band repositioning, hiatal hernia repair or conversion to RYGB (Brethauer, 2014). In individuals initially treated with VBG who are undergoing corrective surgery, approximately 5.6-16.0% of these cases are related to GERD. While revision surgery is an opatiention, revisions do not eliminate the potential mechanical complications; as a result many VBG procedures are converted to an RYGB. Individuals complaining of GERD following biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch are initially treated with conservative measures such as behavioral or medical therapies, while a resleeve or fundectomy surgery is an opatiention for those individuals with GERD refractory to conservative therapy. Surgical treatment of GERD involves augmenting lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, decreasing LES compliance, and, restoring functional anatomy when needed. The gold standard surgical treatment of GERD is laparoscopic antireflux surgery (Flores, 2019). There is no literature regarding the use of bariatric surgery therapy as primary therapy in treatment resistant GERD. Obstruction or stricture The incidence of strictures following bariatric procedures vary based on the initial surgical procedure but is generally reported to be between 1-2% and 16-23.0%. Treatment opatientions include endoscopic balloon dilation, endoscopic dilatation with or without stenting and resection of the stricture to conversion to another procedure, generally RYGB (Brethauer, 2014). Obstructions commonthsnly occur early in the post-operative period

In a 2014 systematic review, Brethauer and colleagues reviewed the current evidence regarding reoperative bariatric surgery. A total of 175 articles covering multiple procedures, such as Roux-en-Y, adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, vertical banded gastroplasty and biliopancreatic diversion with or without duodenal switch, were included. The authors concluded: The reported outcomes after reoperative bariatric surgery are generally favorable and demonthsnstrate that additional weight loss and co-monthsrbidity reduction is achieved with additional therapy. The risks of reoperative bariatric surgery are higher than with primary bariatric surgery and the evidence highlights the need for careful patient selection and surgeon expertise. In addition to surgical complications following bariatric procedures (for example, stricture, erosion, leakage, band slippage), it has been noted that some individuals do not achieve or maintain adequate weight loss post-operatively, despite documented compliance with postoperative nutritional and exercise regimens. In general, it may take up to 2 years to reach maximum weight loss following bariatric surgery. Conversion bariatric surgery may be proposed when adequate weight loss has not occurred after 1 to 2 years following the initial surgery or weight loss has not been maintained. There is overall agreement that adequate weight loss has been achieved when at least 50% of EWL has been achieved, or when the body weight has reached within 30% of ideal weight ranges (by age, gender, height, etc.). Inadequate weight loss due to noncompliance with the recommended postoperative regimens is not considered to be a failure of the original surgery. GERD Increased BMI, waist circumference and weight gain are associated with the presence of GERD (Katz, 2013; Flores, 2019). New-onset GERD, or the exacerbation of GERD is commonthsn following bariatric surgery, affecting up to 33% of individuals (Brethauer, 2014). The typical sympatientoms of GERD include dyspepsia, epigastric pain, early satiety, belching, and bloating (Katz, 2013). As noted by Brethauer (2014) âtreatment of GERD is initially medical with acid suppression but if sympatientoms are refractory to medical therapy or if there is an associated anatomic etiology for the GERD, surgical revision may be requiredâ. The American College of Gastroenterologyâs (ACG) 2013 guideline on GERD notes that a presumpatientive diagnosis of GERD can be made based on a clinical history of heartburn and regurgitation and can be empirically treated with empiric proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The ACG guideline also notes âThe diagnosis of GERD is made using some combination of sympatientom presentation, objective testing with endoscopy, ambulatory reflux monthsnitoring, and response to antisecretory therapyâ. The ACG includes several recommendations regarding objective testing to confirm the diagnosis of GERD: Patients with non-cardiac chest pain suspected due to GERD should have diagnostic evaluation before institution of therapy. (Conditional recommendation, monthsderate level of evidence) A cardiac cause should be excluded in patients with chest pain before the commencement of a gastrointestinal evaluation (Strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Barium radiographs should not be performed to diagnose GERD (Strong recommendation, high level of evidence). Upper endoscopy is not required in the presence of typical GERD sympatientoms. Endoscopy is recommended in the presence of alarm sympatientoms and for screening of patients at high risk for complications. Repeat endoscopy is not indicated in patients without Barrettâs esophagus in the absence of new sympatientoms. (Strong recommendation, monthsderate level of evidence). Ambulatory esophageal reflux monthsnitoring is indicated before consideration of endoscopic or surgical therapy in patients with non-erosive disease (NERD), as part of the evaluation of patients refractory to PPI therapy, and in situations when the diagnosis of GERD is in question. (Strong recommendation, low level evidence). Ambulatory reflux monthsnitoring is the only test that can assess reflux sympatientom association (Strong recommendation, low level of evidence). The incidence of GERD related to bariatric surgery varies with the procedure performed. Approximately 33.3% of LAGB postoperative individuals report exacerbated or new onset GERD at 7 years post-operative. Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has a similar incidence rate of long-term GERD at 20-30%. GERD is initially treated with conservative measures such as acid suppression or band deflation/adjustment in LAGB. If sympatientoms are not controlled by medical therapy, there are several surgical opatientions available including band repositioning, hiatal hernia repair or conversion to RYGB (Brethauer, 2014). In individuals initially treated with VBG who are undergoing corrective surgery, approximately 5.6-16.0% of these cases are related to GERD. While revision surgery is an opatiention, revisions do not eliminate the potential mechanical complications; as a result many VBG procedures are converted to an RYGB. Individuals complaining of GERD following biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch are initially treated with conservative measures such as behavioral or medical therapies, while a resleeve or fundectomy surgery is an opatiention for those individuals with GERD refractory to conservative therapy. Surgical treatment of GERD involves augmenting lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, decreasing LES compliance, and, restoring functional anatomy when needed. The gold standard surgical treatment of GERD is laparoscopic antireflux surgery (Flores, 2019). There is no literature regarding the use of bariatric surgery therapy as primary therapy in treatment resistant GERD. Obstruction or stricture The incidence of strictures following bariatric procedures vary based on the initial surgical procedure but is generally reported to be between 1-2% and 16-23.0%. Treatment opatientions include endoscopic balloon dilation, endoscopic dilatation with or without stenting and resection of the stricture to conversion to another procedure, generally RYGB (Brethauer, 2014). Obstructions commonthsnly occur early in the post-operative period

 7. Timing requirement: during the early âlearning curve.â It is also important that these surgeries be performed in facilities that are appropriately qualified to support peri-operative and post-op services by an appropriately trained, multi-disciplinary team to ensure maximal success. Definitions Adjustable Gastric Banding (AGB): A gastric restrictive procedure in which a gastric band which holds fluid is placed around the exterior of the stomach. Commonthsn complications may include slippage of the external band, band erosion, vomiting and ineffective weight loss. Biliopancreatic Bypass Procedure (also known as the Scopinaro procedure) BPB: A malabsorpatientive procedure, which consists of a subtotal gastrectomy and diversion of the biliopancreatic juices into the small intestine long Roux-en-Y procedure. Potential complications in iron deficiency anemia, protein malnutrition, hypocalcemia, and bone demineralization. Biliopancreatic Bypass with Duodenal Switch (BPD/DS): A variant of the biliopancreatic bypass in which a sleeve gastrectomy is performed instead of a distal gastrectomy. Body mass index (BMI): The key index for relating body weight to height. The BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by their height in meters (m) squared. To convert pounds to kilograms; multiply pounds by 0.45; to convert inches to meters, multiply inches by 0.0254. (See the definition below for obesity for further information). Classifications of Obesity: Adults; children (respectively) BMI of 30 to < 35; BMI >= 95th percentile BMI of 35 to < 40; BMI >= 120% percentile BMI of 40 or higher; BMI >= 140% percentile Excess body weight: This term refers to the difference between an individualâs actual (measured) and ideal body weight. Ideal body weight ranges are established based on height, body frame, gender and age; an example is available from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute [NHLBI] at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl.htm. Accessed on April 11, 2025. Gastric balloon (Gastric bubble): This device is inserted into the stomach to reduce the stomachâs capacity and produce early satiety. It was generally considered obsolete and was originally intended for temporary use as an adjunct to diet and behavior monthsdification to assist with weight loss. Gastric banding: This surgical procedure is intended to help a person lose weight. A band is placed around the upper part of the stomach, creating a small pouch that can hold only a small amonthsunt of food. The narrowed opening between the stomach pouch and the rest of the stomach controls how quickly food passes from the pouch to the lower part of the stomach. This system helps the person to eat less by limiting the amonthsunt of food that can be eaten at one time and increasing the time it takes for food to be digested. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Reflux of gastric contents into the upper structures (such as the esophagus, oral cavity, larynx or lung) which causes sympatientoms or complications. GERD in which there are sympatientoms without erosions present is further classified as nonerosive disease or NERD. GERD with damage or erosions present on endoscopic exam is classified as erosions present or ERD. The diagnosis of GERD is made using some combination of sympatientom presentation, objective testing with endoscopy, ambulatory reflux monthsnitoring, and response to antisecretory therapy. Objective documentation of GERD is by confirmed by the presence of erosive reflux disease on endoscopy and or abnormal pH monthsnitoring. Gastroplasty: A surgical procedure that decreases the size of the stomach. Laparoscopic gastric plication (laparoscopic greater curvature plication [LGCP]): A gastric restrictive bariatric procedure, which is performed alone or in combination with adjustable gastric banding, where the stomachâs volume is reduced by dissecting the greater omentum and short gastric vessels, and the greater curvature is invaginated using multiple rows of non-absorbable sutures performed over a bougie or endoscope to ensure a patent lumen. Long Limb Gastric Bypass (i.e., greater than 150 cm): A malabsorpatientive procedure in which the stomach is bypassed, either by resection or stapling along the horizontal or vertical axis, and the jejunum functions as the alimentary limb. Potential complications are similar to other malabsorpatientive procedures. Obesity: The state of being well above oneâs normal weight, which is measured and determined by the Body Mass Index (BMI). Severe obesity is defined by the NIH as a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater, or a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or greater along with other medical complications. The NIH defines obesity as a BMI of >= 30 kg/m2 and considers a person overweight with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2. Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass (RYGB): A restrictive and malabsorpatientive procedure reduces the stomach capacity and diverts partially digested food from the duodenum to the jejunum (section of the small intestine extending from the duodenum). Often associated with the dumping syndrome in which a large portion of partially digested food is delivered directly to part of the small intestine from the stomach and can cause nausea, weakness, sweating, faintness, abdominal pain and vomiting. This procedure requires that individuals take vitamin and mineral supplements due to decreased ability to absorb nutrients. Complications can include leakage and stomal stricture. Sleep apnea: The temporary stoppage of breathing during sleep, often resulting in daytime sleepiness. Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG): Surgical alternative to gastrectomy which involves resection of the greater curvature of the stomach resulting in a sleeve or tube-shaped stomach remnant. Can be performed alone with followed by a malabsorpatientive procedure. Surgical conversion or revision: Surgery to switch from the initial procedure to a different procedure. Surgical correction or repair: Surgery to correct problems, which are the result of the initial procedure, such as complications or incomplete treatment effect. Surgical reversal: Surgery that restores the original anatomy of an individual. Vertical Banded Gastroplasty (VBG): A gastric restrictive procedure in which the stomach is divided vertically, and a band is stapled around the top portion of the stomach to decrease its size. Commonthsn complications of this procedure include esophageal reflux, as well as either widening or blockage of the narrow portion of the stomach, which may require reoperation.

To convert pounds to kilograms; multiply pounds by 0.45; to convert inches to meters, multiply inches by 0.0254. (See the definition below for obesity for further information). Classifications of Obesity: Adults; children (respectively) BMI of 30 to < 35; BMI >= 95th percentile BMI of 35 to < 40; BMI >= 120% percentile BMI of 40 or higher; BMI >= 140% percentile Excess body weight: This term refers to the difference between an individualâs actual (measured) and ideal body weight. Ideal body weight ranges are established based on height, body frame, gender and age; an example is available from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute [NHLBI] at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/bmi_tbl.htm. Accessed on April 11, 2025. Gastric balloon (Gastric bubble): This device is inserted into the stomach to reduce the stomachâs capacity and produce early satiety. It was generally considered obsolete and was originally intended for temporary use as an adjunct to diet and behavior monthsdification to assist with weight loss. Gastric banding: This surgical procedure is intended to help a person lose weight. A band is placed around the upper part of the stomach, creating a small pouch that can hold only a small amonthsunt of food. The narrowed opening between the stomach pouch and the rest of the stomach controls how quickly food passes from the pouch to the lower part of the stomach. This system helps the person to eat less by limiting the amonthsunt of food that can be eaten at one time and increasing the time it takes for food to be digested. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Reflux of gastric contents into the upper structures (such as the esophagus, oral cavity, larynx or lung) which causes sympatientoms or complications. GERD in which there are sympatientoms without erosions present is further classified as nonerosive disease or NERD. GERD with damage or erosions present on endoscopic exam is classified as erosions present or ERD. The diagnosis of GERD is made using some combination of sympatientom presentation, objective testing with endoscopy, ambulatory reflux monthsnitoring, and response to antisecretory therapy. Objective documentation of GERD is by confirmed by the presence of erosive reflux disease on endoscopy and or abnormal pH monthsnitoring. Gastroplasty: A surgical procedure that decreases the size of the stomach. Laparoscopic gastric plication (laparoscopic greater curvature plication [LGCP]): A gastric restrictive bariatric procedure, which is performed alone or in combination with adjustable gastric banding, where the stomachâs volume is reduced by dissecting the greater omentum and short gastric vessels, and the greater curvature is invaginated using multiple rows of non-absorbable sutures performed over a bougie or endoscope to ensure a patent lumen. Long Limb Gastric Bypass (i.e., greater than 150 cm): A malabsorpatientive procedure in which the stomach is bypassed, either by resection or stapling along the horizontal or vertical axis, and the jejunum functions as the alimentary limb. Potential complications are similar to other malabsorpatientive procedures. Obesity: The state of being well above oneâs normal weight, which is measured and determined by the Body Mass Index (BMI). Severe obesity is defined by the NIH as a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater, or a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or greater along with other medical complications. The NIH defines obesity as a BMI of >= 30 kg/m2 and considers a person overweight with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2. Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass (RYGB): A restrictive and malabsorpatientive procedure reduces the stomach capacity and diverts partially digested food from the duodenum to the jejunum (section of the small intestine extending from the duodenum). Often associated with the dumping syndrome in which a large portion of partially digested food is delivered directly to part of the small intestine from the stomach and can cause nausea, weakness, sweating, faintness, abdominal pain and vomiting. This procedure requires that individuals take vitamin and mineral supplements due to decreased ability to absorb nutrients. Complications can include leakage and stomal stricture. Sleep apnea: The temporary stoppage of breathing during sleep, often resulting in daytime sleepiness. Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG): Surgical alternative to gastrectomy which involves resection of the greater curvature of the stomach resulting in a sleeve or tube-shaped stomach remnant. Can be performed alone with followed by a malabsorpatientive procedure. Surgical conversion or revision: Surgery to switch from the initial procedure to a different procedure. Surgical correction or repair: Surgery to correct problems, which are the result of the initial procedure, such as complications or incomplete treatment effect. Surgical reversal: Surgery that restores the original anatomy of an individual. Vertical Banded Gastroplasty (VBG): A gastric restrictive procedure in which the stomach is divided vertically, and a band is stapled around the top portion of the stomach to decrease its size. Commonthsn complications of this procedure include esophageal reflux, as well as either widening or blockage of the narrow portion of the stomach, which may require reoperation.

Definitions Adjustable Gastric Banding (AGB): A gastric restrictive procedure in which a gastric band which holds fluid is placed around the exterior of the stomach. Commonthsn complications may include slippage of the external band, band erosion, vomiting and ineffective weight loss. Biliopancreatic Bypass Procedure (also known as the Scopinaro procedure) BPB: A malabsorpatientive procedure, which consists of a subtotal gastrectomy and diversion of the biliopancreatic juices into the small intestine long Roux-en-Y procedure.
