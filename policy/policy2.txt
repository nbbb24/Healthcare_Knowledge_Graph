Status: Reviewed / Active

Description
This document addresses the medical necessity of diagnostic testing, pharmacologic therapy, and procedural interventions for the management of clinically significant heart disease. Heart disease encompasses a range of cardiovascular disorders, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and valvular heart disease. Appropriate evaluation and evidence-based treatment are critical to reduce morbidity, improve quality of life, and prevent premature mortality.

Clinical Indications

Medically Necessary
The following interventions for heart disease are considered medically necessary when all of the criteria below are met:
	1.	Age Requirement: Individual is 18 years of age or older (pediatric cases are addressed in separate guidelines).
	2.	Clinical Presentation: Documentation of one or more of the following:
	•	Symptoms consistent with ischemia (e.g., angina, exertional dyspnea).
	•	Evidence of structural or functional abnormality on diagnostic imaging (echocardiogram, MRI, CT angiography).
	•	Clinically significant arrhythmia documented on ECG, Holter, or event monitor.
	•	Diagnosis of heart failure with NYHA Class II–IV symptoms.
	3.	Diagnostic Work-up: Prior evaluation with non-invasive testing (e.g., exercise stress test, echocardiography, cardiac biomarkers) and invasive testing (e.g., cardiac catheterization) when indicated.
	4.	Conservative Management: Documentation of attempted or contraindicated conservative measures, including risk factor control (blood pressure, lipids, diabetes), lifestyle modification, and pharmacologic therapy (e.g., ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, statins, antiarrhythmics).
	5.	Advanced Interventions: For surgical or device-based therapy (e.g., CABG, valve repair/replacement, pacemaker, ICD), there must be evidence that:
	•	The intervention addresses the underlying disease pathology; and
	•	The expected clinical benefit outweighs potential risks.

Not Medically Necessary
Interventions are considered not medically necessary when:
	•	The above criteria are not met;
	•	The proposed procedure is investigational or experimental;
	•	There is insufficient documentation of disease severity, prior therapy, or clinical benefit.
